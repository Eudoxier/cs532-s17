## Thinking Like a Black Hat

Possible Attack Vectors:

*  This graph analysis method could be (and probably has been) used for:
  *  Instigating instability in a known weak point between fraction in a government or organization.
  *  To pick out the most likely to defect members of an organization or government to approach.

## Maths

*  Mathematical structures known as capacitated networks.
*  Network Flows or Ford-Fulkerson problems
*  Maximum flow—minimum cut labeling procedure

## Political

> During the factional confrontations which preceded the fission, the  
club meeting remained the setting for decision making. If, at a given  
meeting, one  faction  held a majority, it would attempt to pass    
resolutions and decisions favorable to its ideological position. The other  
faction would then retaliate at a future meeting when it held the   
majority, by repealing the unfavorable decisions and substituting ones favorable to itself. Thus, the outcome of any crisis was determined by  
which faction was able to "stack" the meetings most successfully.

Sounds a lot like US politics...

## Interesting Quotes from the Paper

> Conflict  in  any  setting  must  be  bounded  by  some  sharing  of  rules  
which  allows  the  combatants  or  contestants  to  know  what  and  how  they  
are  contesting.  This  knowledge  can  be  at  any  level,  from  the  rules  of  a  
game,  to  the  shared  meanings  of  ritual  items  for  the
  gumsa
  and
  gumlao  
Kachin  (Leach  1954).  Whatever  the  level,  these  rules  must  continue  to  
be  understood  by  both  players  of the  game,  or  the  conflict  ceases  as  the  
activity  becomes  undefined  for  the  players.  

> Anthropologically, the approach used to build the model is processual
rather  than  static. The network model is constructed from a view of  
the social system as a processor of information — a cybernetic     
machine—rather than as a static set of relationships.
