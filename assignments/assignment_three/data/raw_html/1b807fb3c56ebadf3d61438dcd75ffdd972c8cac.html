The sheer pervasiveness of these risks, matched with the evolution into far more complex attacks, means the C-Suite has to get serious about managing cybersecurity. I sat down with Steffan Tomlinson this month, CFO of Palo Alto Networks, who explains why CFOs should be at the helm of these efforts, drawing on their risk management know-how and developing additional skills through continuing education.\r\n\r\n<em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Jeff Thomson: </strong>Cyber risks and business impacts of actual data breaches are greater now than ever before.&nbsp;Do you see CFOs and their teams building the competency necessary to play a leading role in addressing cyber risk?&nbsp;What should this role be?\r\n\r\n<strong>Steffan Tomlinson: </strong>As the threat of cyberattacks and cyber risk continues to increase, I foresee CFOs across the world learning, adapting and building competency to successfully address this critical challenge. There are many creative approaches I have witnessed CFOs employ to build their competency in cybersecurity, but the one that most commonly stands out is when the CFO views cybersecurity through the lens of Enterprise Risk Management [ERM].\r\n<p class=\"tweet_line\">[tweet_quote display=\"Cybersecurity is typically in the top 5 risks of a corporation &amp; a key aspect of a CFOs role is to help manage that.\"]Cybersecurity is typically in the top five risks of a corporation and a key aspect of a CFO&rsquo;s role is to help manage that risk[/tweet_quote] . Viewing cyber risk through the lens of ERM enables the CFO to use a framework, process and strategy to help position the company to successfully manage the plan for cybersecurity. This approach provides a familiar environment for the CFO to get educated and bring pragmatism and a business context to the dialogue on cybersecurity.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thomson: </strong>There is a school of thought that data breaches are going to happen anyway, so just be prepared and proactive for the aftermath including communicating with customers and shareholders. What is your view on the balance between cyber risk prevention, detection and disaster recovery/business continuity?\r\n\r\n<strong>Tomlinson: </strong>It is important to think in a systematic, holistic way when crafting a cybersecurity strategy and there is a wide array of considerations for which you have to plan. However, the philosophical approach about where to start is extremely important as it provides the foundation on which to build the overall cyber strategy.\r\n\r\nI don&rsquo;t ascribe to the school of thought that data breaches are a fait accompli. In fact, the most successful, forward-thinking companies that I have seen to date start with a breach prevention-oriented, highly-automated and integrated approach as the foundation on which to build their cybersecurity strategy. Upon this foundation, other important capabilities like forensics, remediation, incident response, etc., fit into the overall plan, but a prevention-first mindset is the foundational element.\r\n\r\nAt Palo Alto Networks, we view the cybersecurity challenge, in part, as a math problem. As the cost of compute power goes down, the number of attacks and breaches goes up. An automated, integrated next-generation security platform that secures a company&rsquo;s data in the network, endpoint and cloud is an essential starting point to increase the cost for an attacker to successfully breach an organization and, thereby, discourage the attacker to continue their efforts.<!--nextpage-->\r\n\r\n<strong>Thomson: </strong>In what ways can CFOs ramp up their data security expertise to be able to contribute to these crucial business conversations? Do you need to be an expert on security protocols, encryption, data storage, etc.?\r\n\r\n<strong>Tomlinson: </strong>The good news is CFOs don&rsquo;t have to be technical experts in security protocols, encryption, data storage, etc. but they do need to have a working knowledge of cyber and data security. There are a number of techniques to ramp up knowledge and demystify cybersecurity, three of which come immediately to mind.\r\n\r\n&bull; It starts with hiring the right CIO and CISO and spending time with both to get a business review of their own cybersecurity environment. Many questions will arise out of these reviews, which will lead to learning and developing competency.\r\n\r\n&bull; CFOs have access to a number of different service providers, including all of the &ldquo;Big 4 Accounting Firms,&rdquo; which have cyber practices. Those firms are always eager to share observations and best practices to help bolster an organization&rsquo;s overall cyber posture.\r\n\r\n&bull; There also is online and print material that CFOs can tap into, such as <a href=\"https://get.info.paloaltonetworks.com/webApp/navigating-the-digital-age-en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Navigating the Digital Age</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.securityroundtable.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SecurityRoundtable.org</a>. These materials provide best practices and state-of-the-art information that is highly valuable in terms of building out knowledge and strategy for CFOs and other executives and board members regarding cyber.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thomson: </strong>As CFO of Palo Alto Networks, you oversee the finance, accounting, IT, and manufacturing functions.&nbsp;Is this unique to your company or your skill set?&nbsp;To what extent are CFOs going beyond the numbers and managing or influencing strategy, operations and technology?\r\n\r\n<strong>Tomlinson: </strong>Over the years, the CFO role has evolved into being both more operational and strategic, so I count myself in good company with many other CFOs across all industries. In this day and age, the fact that CFOs are contributing to the strategy of a company is table stakes. In many cases CFOs manage IT, so by definition they are helping shape the technology footprint, business process optimization and automation efforts. These are just two examples, of many, which capture the increasing role CFOs are playing in helping run the business.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the expanded role of the CFO is a benefit to the business because they become better business partners. This positive dynamic shines through in the financial planning and operating portions of the business. Financial, operational and strategic planning are all intertwined and CFOs play a central role in each of these aspects.\r\n\r\n<strong>Thomson: </strong>What trends are you anticipating in 2017 that relate to cyber security and associated risks?&nbsp; For example, do you see data breach management becoming a true business process integrating data security, technical protocols, business continuity and crisis management (in effect, an integration of business processes spanning strategy, IT, PR, etc.)?&nbsp; What new prevention technologies are on the horizon, i.e., will the sophisticated hackers ever get caught?\r\n\r\n<strong>Tomlinson: </strong>I believe 2017 will be marked as a year where security IQ will grow exponentially. To begin, it&rsquo;s my belief that executive teams, boards and senior leadership regardless of role will (and need to become) more in tune with security risk, the impact of such events, the need to play a part in understanding the overall security posture of the company and how each can contribute to breach prevention-oriented measures in three key areas: people, process, and technology.\r\n\r\nIn addition to progressing prevention-oriented measures, companies should already be thinking about synergizing security, IT, corporate communications and business continuity as part of their breach response planning.&nbsp;This needs to extend beyond the traditional borders of modern companies; it should be expanded to include the new fuzzy borders of modern companies, like partner organizations, manufacturing, SaaS (cloud providers) and other supply chain contributors. Enterprises that haven&rsquo;t done the necessary due diligence to pull these together are behind the curve. A breach is a catalyst for many gears to start turning, and dealing with this in the moment of crisis leads to poor outcomes.\r\n\r\nWhile highly automated threats continuing to plague the industry, the scarcity of security talent will drive the need for preventative security, automation and security orchestration in the midst of the cloud shift that continues to change the face of our technology environments. The appetite for preventative security will continue to expand, enabling security practitioners to stay focused on the critical signals in the noise.&nbsp;Because of these growing pain points, 2017 will introduce a massive rise in a platform approach to security, as it is becoming increasingly important for all the technologies that play a part in the security machine to work together to enable full visibility across the tech stack.</p>","description":"CFO of Palo Alto Networks, Steffan Tomlinson, on the CFOs role in cybersecurity.","image":"https://www.forbes.com/dam/imageserve/524764399/x.jpg","type":"blog","storyType":"post","uri":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffthomson/2017/01/31/why-cybersecurity-should-be-the-cfos-job/","comments":[],"visible":true,"blogId":"2325","authors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/10313","name":"Jeff Thomson","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jeffthomson/files/2016/10/Jeff-Thomson_avatar_1476901531-40x40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jeffthomson/files/2016/10/Jeff-Thomson_avatar_1476901531-62x62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jeffthomson/files/2016/10/Jeff-Thomson_avatar_1476901531-136x136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jeffthomson/files/2016/10/Jeff-Thomson_avatar_1476901531-400x400.jpg"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffthomson/","primaryChannel":{"id":"channel_6","channelId":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership","shortName":"Leadership","displayName":"Leadership"},"type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/jeffthomson/","twitterName":"IMA_News","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"IMAnetORG","email":"ima@sternassociates.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about CFO insights.","webSite":"http://www.imanet.org/ima_home.aspx","timestamp":1476901587222,"description":"I’m president and CEO of IMA (Institute of Management Accountants).

The sheer pervasiveness of these risks, matched with the evolution into far more complex attacks, means the C-Suite has to get serious about managing cybersecurity. I sat down with Steffan Tomlinson this month, CFO of Palo Alto Networks, who explains why CFOs should be at the helm of these efforts, drawing on their risk management know-how and developing additional skills through continuing education.</p>\n<p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Jeff Thomson: </strong>Cyber risks and business impacts of actual data breaches are greater now than ever before.&nbsp;Do you see CFOs and their teams building the competency necessary to play a leading role in addressing cyber risk?&nbsp;What should this role be?</p>\n<p><strong>Steffan Tomlinson: </strong>As the threat of cyberattacks and cyber risk continues to increase, I foresee CFOs across the world learning, adapting and building competency to successfully address this critical challenge. There are many creative approaches I have witnessed CFOs employ to build their competency in cybersecurity, but the one that most commonly stands out is when the CFO views cybersecurity through the lens of Enterprise Risk Management [ERM].</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p class=\"tweet_line\"><span class=\"tweet_quote\"> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fjeffthomson%2F2017%2F01%2F31%2Fwhy-cybersecurity-should-be-the-cfos-job%2F&amp;text=Cybersecurity%20is%20typically%20in%20the%20top%205%20risks%20of%20a%20corporation%20%26%20a%20key%20aspect%20of%20a%20CFOs%20role%20is%20to%20help%20manage%20that.\" target=\"_blank\">Cybersecurity is typically in the top five risks of a corporation and a key aspect of a CFO’s role is to help manage that risk<span></span></a></span> . Viewing cyber risk through the lens of ERM enables the CFO to use a framework, process and strategy to help position the company to successfully manage the plan for cybersecurity. This approach provides a familiar environment for the CFO to get educated and bring pragmatism and a business context to the dialogue on cybersecurity.</p>\n<p><strong>Thomson: </strong>There is a school of thought that data breaches are going to happen anyway, so just be prepared and proactive for the aftermath including communicating with customers and shareholders. What is your view on the balance between cyber risk prevention, detection and disaster recovery/business continuity?</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Tomlinson: </strong>It is important to think in a systematic, holistic way when crafting a cybersecurity strategy and there is a wide array of considerations for which you have to plan. However, the philosophical approach about where to start is extremely important as it provides the foundation on which to build the overall cyber strategy.</p>\n<p>I don’t ascribe to the school of thought that data breaches are a fait accompli. In fact, the most successful, forward-thinking companies that I have seen to date start with a breach prevention-oriented, highly-automated and integrated approach as the foundation on which to build their cybersecurity strategy. Upon this foundation, other important capabilities like forensics, remediation, incident response, etc., fit into the overall plan, but a prevention-first mindset is the foundational element.</p>\n<p>At Palo Alto Networks, we view the cybersecurity challenge, in part, as a math problem. As the cost of compute power goes down, the number of attacks and breaches goes up. An automated, integrated next-generation security platform that secures a company’s data in the network, endpoint and cloud is an essential starting point to increase the cost for an attacker to successfully breach an organization and, thereby, discourage the attacker to continue their efforts.</p>","<p><strong>Thomson: </strong>In what ways can CFOs ramp up their data security expertise to be able to contribute to these crucial business conversations? Do you need to be an expert on security protocols, encryption, data storage, etc.?</p>\n<p><strong>Tomlinson: </strong>The good news is CFOs don’t have to be technical experts in security protocols, encryption, data storage, etc. but they do need to have a working knowledge of cyber and data security. There are a number of techniques to ramp up knowledge and demystify cybersecurity, three of which come immediately to mind.</p>\n<p>• It starts with hiring the right CIO and CISO and spending time with both to get a business review of their own cybersecurity environment. Many questions will arise out of these reviews, which will lead to learning and developing competency.</p>\n<div id=\"inread\" article-ad-inbody=\"inread\" class=\"inread\"></div>\n<p>• CFOs have access to a number of different service providers, including all of the “Big 4 Accounting Firms,” which have cyber practices. Those firms are always eager to share observations and best practices to help bolster an organization’s overall cyber posture.</p>\n<p>• There also is online and print material that CFOs can tap into, such as <a href=\"https://get.info.paloaltonetworks.com/webApp/navigating-the-digital-age-en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Navigating the Digital Age</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.securityroundtable.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SecurityRoundtable.org</a>. These materials provide best practices and state-of-the-art information that is highly valuable in terms of building out knowledge and strategy for CFOs and other executives and board members regarding cyber.</p>\n<div class=\"vestpocket\" vest-pocket=\"\"></div>\n<p><strong>Thomson: </strong>As CFO of Palo Alto Networks, you oversee the finance, accounting, IT, and manufacturing functions.&nbsp;Is this unique to your company or your skill set?&nbsp;To what extent are CFOs going beyond the numbers and managing or influencing strategy, operations and technology?</p>\n<p><strong>Tomlinson: </strong>Over the years, the CFO role has evolved into being both more operational and strategic, so I count myself in good company with many other CFOs across all industries. In this day and age, the fact that CFOs are contributing to the strategy of a company is table stakes. In many cases CFOs manage IT, so by definition they are helping shape the technology footprint, business process optimization and automation efforts. These are just two examples, of many, which capture the increasing role CFOs are playing in helping run the business.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the expanded role of the CFO is a benefit to the business because they become better business partners. This positive dynamic shines through in the financial planning and operating portions of the business. Financial, operational and strategic planning are all intertwined and CFOs play a central role in each of these aspects.</p>\n<p><strong>Thomson: </strong>What trends are you anticipating in 2017 that relate to cyber security and associated risks?&nbsp; For example, do you see data breach management becoming a true business process integrating data security, technical protocols, business continuity and crisis management (in effect, an integration of business processes spanning strategy, IT, PR, etc.)?&nbsp; What new prevention technologies are on the horizon, i.e., will the sophisticated hackers ever get caught?</p>\n<p><strong>Tomlinson: </strong>I believe 2017 will be marked as a year where security IQ will grow exponentially. To begin, it’s my belief that executive teams, boards and senior leadership regardless of role will (and need to become) more in tune with security risk, the impact of such events, the need to play a part in understanding the overall security posture of the company and how each can contribute to breach prevention-oriented measures in three key areas: people, process, and technology.</p>\n<p>In addition to progressing prevention-oriented measures, companies should already be thinking about synergizing security, IT, corporate communications and business continuity as part of their breach response planning.&nbsp;This needs to extend beyond the traditional borders of modern companies; it should be expanded to include the new fuzzy borders of modern companies, like partner organizations, manufacturing, SaaS (cloud providers) and other supply chain contributors. Enterprises that haven’t done the necessary due diligence to pull these together are behind the curve. A breach is a catalyst for many gears to start turning, and dealing with this in the moment of crisis leads to poor outcomes.</p>\n<p>While highly automated threats continuing to plague the industry, the scarcity of security talent will drive the need for preventative security, automation and security orchestration in the midst of the cloud shift that continues to change the face of our technology environments. The appetite for preventative security will continue to expand, enabling security practitioners to stay focused on the critical signals in the noise.&nbsp;Because of these growing pain points, 2017 will introduce a massive rise in a platform approach to security, as it is becoming increasingly important for all the technologies that play a part in the security machine to work together to enable full visibility across the tech stack.</p>"],"disableDigest":false,"writtenByForbesStaff":false,"doNotPaginate":false,"channelSectionMappings":[{"id":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership","displayName":"Leadership"},{"id":"channel_6section_283","channelName":"Leadership","sectionName":"CFO Network","url":"/cfo-network","displayName":"CFO Network"}],"pTagCount":22,"hashtags":["CyberSecurity"],"editorsPick":false,"numberOfImages":1,"sentimentCompanies":[],"trumpContent":false,"brandVoiceTitle":"Why Cybersecurity Should Be The CFO's Job","digestDisabled":false,"authorType":"Contributor","allIndividualAuthors":[{"naturalId":"blogAuthorId/blog/author/10313","name":"Jeff Thomson","avatars":[{"size":40,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jeffthomson/files/2016/10/Jeff-Thomson_avatar_1476901531-40x40.jpg"},{"size":62,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jeffthomson/files/2016/10/Jeff-Thomson_avatar_1476901531-62x62.jpg"},{"size":136,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jeffthomson/files/2016/10/Jeff-Thomson_avatar_1476901531-136x136.jpg"},{"size":400,"image":"http://blogs-images.forbes.com/jeffthomson/files/2016/10/Jeff-Thomson_avatar_1476901531-400x400.jpg"}],"url":"http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffthomson/","primaryChannel":{"id":"channel_6","channelId":"channel_6","channelName":"Leadership","url":"/leadership","shortName":"Leadership","displayName":"Leadership"},"type":"Contributor","profileUrl":"/sites/jeffthomson/","twitterName":"IMA_News","authorType":"individual","facebookName":"IMAnetORG","email":"ima@sternassociates.com","blog":false,"numFollowers":0,"shortBio":"I write about CFO insights.","webSite":"http://www.imanet.org/ima_home.aspx","timestamp":1476901587222,"description":"I’m president and CEO of IMA (Institute of Management Accountants).

<p>Cyber risk is a 21st&nbsp;century business reality and something that can’t be ignored. The sheer pervasiveness of these risks, matched with the evolution into far more complex attacks, means the C-Suite has to get serious about managing cybersecurity. I sat down with Steffan Tomlinson this month, CFO of Palo Alto Networks, who explains why CFOs should be at the helm of these efforts, drawing on their risk management know-how and developing additional skills through continuing education.</p>
<p><em>This interview has been edited and condensed.</em></p>
<p><strong>Jeff Thomson: </strong>Cyber risks and business impacts of actual data breaches are greater now than ever before.&nbsp;Do you see CFOs and their teams building the competency necessary to play a leading role in addressing cyber risk?&nbsp;What should this role be?</p>
<p><strong>Steffan Tomlinson: </strong>As the threat of cyberattacks and cyber risk continues to increase, I foresee CFOs across the world learning, adapting and building competency to successfully address this critical challenge. There are many creative approaches I have witnessed CFOs employ to build their competency in cybersecurity, but the one that most commonly stands out is when the CFO views cybersecurity through the lens of Enterprise Risk Management [ERM].</p>

Viewing cyber risk through the lens of ERM enables the CFO to use a framework, process and strategy to help position the company to successfully manage the plan for cybersecurity. This approach provides a familiar environment for the CFO to get educated and bring pragmatism and a business context to the dialogue on cybersecurity.</p>
<p><strong>Thomson: </strong>There is a school of thought that data breaches are going to happen anyway, so just be prepared and proactive for the aftermath including communicating with customers and shareholders. What is your view on the balance between cyber risk prevention, detection and disaster recovery/business continuity?</p>
<div class="vestpocket" vest-pocket=""></div>
<p><strong>Tomlinson: </strong>It is important to think in a systematic, holistic way when crafting a cybersecurity strategy and there is a wide array of considerations for which you have to plan. However, the philosophical approach about where to start is extremely important as it provides the foundation on which to build the overall cyber strategy.</p>
<p>I don’t ascribe to the school of thought that data breaches are a fait accompli. In fact, the most successful, forward-thinking companies that I have seen to date start with a breach prevention-oriented, highly-automated and integrated approach as the foundation on which to build their cybersecurity strategy. Upon this foundation, other important capabilities like forensics, remediation, incident response, etc., fit into the overall plan, but a prevention-first mindset is the foundational element.</p>
<p>At Palo Alto Networks, we view the cybersecurity challenge, in part, as a math problem. As the cost of compute power goes down, the number of attacks and breaches goes up. An automated, integrated next-generation security platform that secures a company’s data in the network, endpoint and cloud is an essential starting point to increase the cost for an attacker to successfully breach an organization and, thereby, discourage the attacker to continue their efforts.</p></div><div class="spinner preload-hidden" ng-if="!article.article && article.type === 'spinner'"><div class="bounce1"></div><div class="bounce2"></div><div class="bounce3"></div></div><div class="arrow bounce icon icon-chevron-down preload-hidden" ng-if="!!article.article && article.type === 'spinner'"></div></div><!-- Add Start Gallery Button --><div class="preload-hidden" ng-if="::(article.article.templateType === 'gallery')"><a class="btn-start-gallery" ng-href="{{::gallery_url}}" target="_self">Start Gallery</a></div><!-- Article Guest Contributor Bottom --><div class="article-guest-contrib clearfix preload-hidden" ng-if="article.article.guestContributor && article.article.guestContributor.position === 'bottom'" ng-include="" src="guest_contrib_template"></div><!-- Page controls --><div ng-if="article.article.pages.length > 1 && article.type === 'article'" class="article-pagination preload-hidden"><a ng-href="{{url_path}}{{url_prev}}{{ss}}" ng-if="article.article.page > 0" class="article-pagination-prev" target="_self"><i class="icon icon-chevron-left"></i></a> Page <strong>{{article.article.page + 1}}</strong> / <strong>{{article.article.pages.length}}</strong> <a ng-href="{{url_path}}{{url_next}}{{ss}}" ng-if="article.article.page < article.article.pages.length - 1" class="article-pagination-next" target="_self">Continue <i class="icon icon-chevron-right"></i></a></div><!-- THIS NEEDS TO MOVE FROM HERE --><div class="article-comment preload-hidden" ng-class="{'mobile-comment' : is_mobile}" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><a class="comments-link" ng-if="article.article.showComments" ng-click="openComments(article.index)" data-track="article-comment-this"><div class="comments-cta" ng-class="{'no-comments' : !article.article.calledOutCommentCount}"><div class="count"><strong>{{article.article.calledOutCommentCount||''}}</strong></div><span>Comment on this story</span></div></a></div><div article-sharing="" class="article-bottom-sharing article-sharing preload-hidden" data-track="body-bottom"></div><!-- Prints, Reprints & corrections bar --><div class="article-print-bar preload-hidden" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><ul><li class="print"><a ng-href="{{url_path}}print/" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-print"></i> <span>Print</span></a></li><li><a ng-click="openCorrectionsEmail()"><i class="icon icon-edit"></i> <span>Report Corrections</span></a></li><li><a href="http://forbesreprints.magreprints.com" target="_blank"><i class="icon icon-terms"></i> <span>Reprints &amp; Permissions</span></a></li></ul></div><!-- Related ads--><div class="related-ads-container" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><!-- Media net related links --><div id="media_net_0_article_{{article.index}}" class="media_net_related_links initialized anim" article-related-links="{{article.index}}"></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="speed-bump-wrapper" ng-if="article.type === 'article'"><!-- Around the web ad --><div class="article-speed-bump" speed-bump=""></div></div></div></div><div ng-if="article.type === 'stream' && is_mobile && article.stream && article.stream.length > 0" id="article-bottom-stream" class="article-stream-container clearfix preload-hidden"><div class="article-stream-padding"><div ng-controller="ArticleStreamInlineController" class="clearfix"><h2 class="trending-header">Trending on <i class="logo icon icon-forbes-logo"><span>Forbes</span></i> {{channel_name}}</h2><section class="article-post-article"><div ng-include="" src="article_stream_template"></div></section></div></div></div></article></div><div intx-ad=""></div></section></div></div><div class="sticky-fbs-ad-container preload-hidden" ng-if="is_mobile && !no_ads_template"><div id="mobile-sticky" dynamic-ad-unit="mobile" class="ad mobile-sticky-fbs-ad anim"></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">setTimeout(function() {
