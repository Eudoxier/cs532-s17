<P align=left>Hello Sir,</P>
<P align=left>I would like to let you know that your ebook has helped me save a lot in buying books on raising various types of livestock.</P>
<P align=left>When I started raising cattle I went to a local farming seminar which cost me over $300 to attend and at the end of the seminar I had to buy a cattle handbook which cost $76.</P>
<P align=left>Later last month I decided to start raising goats as well but just wasn't prepared to spend money again on seminars, I knew that there must be cheaper training.</P>
<P align=left>When searching online for a guide to raising goats I came across your ebook. And since it teaches how to raise various livestock including goats at a fraction of the cost of the seminar I attended in only raising cattle, I didn't think twice but to get a copy.</P>
<P align=left>I must say that your ebook does over deliver, it has all in the information they taught us in that raising cattle seminar. Amazing!</P>
<P align=left>I'm so excited now because I got all the guidelines and reference&nbsp;to raise goats, chickens, sheep and rabbits just from your ebook. I don't have to spend money in attending seminars or buying individual books.</P>

<P align=left>All&nbsp;I can say to a person who is still thinking of getting this livestock ebook that I highly recommend you do.</P>
<P align=left>I'm an advanced livestock farmer with years of experience and I&nbsp;learned to be a successful farmer the hard way. I had lots of herds dying&nbsp;at a young age and through diseases that I never knew anything about. And that has cost me a lot. There's a time I sort of regretted being a farmer because I felt it was such a hustle and the&nbsp;return in&nbsp;investment&nbsp;was&nbsp;minimal.&nbsp;</P>
<P align=left>I came across your ebook when looking for treatment for one my cattle that&nbsp;persistently failed to breed and bear young. It was&nbsp;now 3 years&nbsp;and I knew that I had to find a solution.</P>
<P align=left>Reading that your ebook&nbsp;gives guidelines on raising cattle as well I just had to get a copy. After reading a few chapters, how I wished I had gotten it earlier. All the problems I faced in my novice years are covered. I even found the solution of how to treat my cattle not bearing young in your ebook. Its suitable for a beginner and advanced farmer.</P>
<P align=left>I've always had second thoughts in raising ducks and sheep because of the bad experience I got from raising cattle. But now its not the same, I'm starting with ducks, then sheep later next year using your ebook as reference.</P>

<P>You see, <STRONG>beginner livestock farmers face a lot of difficulties</STRONG> when raising livestock. Livestock is not that difficult to raise if you know how to.
