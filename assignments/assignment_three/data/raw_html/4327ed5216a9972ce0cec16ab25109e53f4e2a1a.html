With quick-witted dialogue and impressive in-camera special effects, writer and director Kevin Lim\u2019s chamber piece explores romance and gender roles through the guise of a workaholic. If you expect to be bored by the simplicity of two actors conversing across a table from one another, you\u2019ll surely reconsider after you watch this. <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whispers Among Wolves <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reminds us that you don\u2019t need to have a myriad of locations and action sequences to keep us entertained so long as you have strong characters and a great story.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many filmmakers, myself included, believable dialogue that forwards a story is one of the hardest aspects of screenwriting. Not everyone can be Aaron Sorkin, but Kevin Lim may be close, creating scenes with dueling dialogue that reveal the two character\u2019s traits and motivations as they attempt to get on the same wavelength. Lim's talent for dialogue is even better illustrated with his playful use of language. Between the performances of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sarah Aubrey (Shilo) and Matthew Backer (Teddy)<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Lim's characters feel absolutely alive. <em>\"She looks like a giraffe trying to solve a complex sudoku puzzle. Put the poor creature out of her misery and drop the facade\u2019,\u201d<\/em> Shilo draws to which Teddy replies, <em>\u201cWhat Facade?\u201d<\/em> A simple question to a colorfully phrased statement, it catapults the business meeting into very intimate territory. <\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While 90% of the film takes place sitting at a dining table in a fancy restaurant, the film is impressively engaging and visual. Lim elaborated on some of the deceivingly difficult special effects to us, revealing that the flashbacks to the cocktail party were all in-camera scene changes. So while most people may believe there was digital trickery involved in which two separately shot scenes were stitched together, the dining and cocktail party was surprisingly all shot in camera <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at the same time<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The lead actress had to run from one side of the restaurant to the other with a 30 second quick change into a cocktail dress while 20 extras rushed into position. Add four different lighting changes, and you have yourself a party. An impressive feat of blocking, it adds a uniquely theatrical feel to Lim\u2019s storytelling and is certainly worth the payoff.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lim has been on our radar: we featured <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/2014\/06\/10\/lichen\/\">Lichen<\/a> <\/em>in 2014, and thus were excited when\u00a0this short came our way.\u00a0Screening at <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the Sydney Film Festival, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whispers Among Wolves <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">was nominated for the Dendy Awards for Australian Short Films.

There\u2019s no easy way, really. Pick a date. Follow through. Hopefully, it won\u2019t coincide with your surprise 25th anniversary party, or you might end up like the couple in this film, renewing their vows before taking the first steps to dissolving their marriage. Vows shows us how two people process a life-changing event by focusing on the event from two different perspectives.<\/p>\r\n<p>Vows tells the story of Amos and his wife Orit. He plans to leave her; she\u2019s excited about their anniversary and unaware of his unhappiness. As could be expected, the conversation is awkward. As a whole, the film is an exquisitely ironic portrayal of a middle-aged breakup that deals with an excruciating experience without making much of a fuss. There aren\u2019t any heated arguments, public meltdowns, or accusations of adultery; instead, Amos and Orit\u2019s night is filled with whispers, glances, and words left unsaid, as the situation is handled\u2013as it must be\u2013with discretion. They\u2019re both forced to smile through the pain, lest their friends and family find out what\u2019s wrong.<\/p>\r\n<p>Vows plays with point of view to great effect. While Amos starts the film laughing in a car with his lover, Orit ends the film onstage, listening to her husband\u2019s wedding vows with quivering lips. After she learns the truth (at the halfway mark), the film takes on the tone and silence of shell shock\u2013minus the heartbeat that tends to accompany the effect. In short, it\u2019s a private crisis in a public place, and as such, the couple isn\u2019t able to say much to each other. But what they don\u2019t say communicates volumes about the state of their relationship.<\/p>\r\n<p>Though this film is written from the perspective of both husband and wife, it was actually written by the son, who based it off a true story about his parents\u2019 silver wedding party. <em>\u201cWhen I started talking with them about their silver-wedding, I found out that my father had originally planned to tell my mother about his decision to leave her that weekend,\u201d<\/em> writes Tal Miller, the film\u2019s screenwriter. <em>\u201cThat big celebration we planned for them became the symbol for the failure of their marriage.\u201d<\/em> Director Tal Zagreba had a surprise of his own in store for the film crew: at the last moment, he decided that each scene would be filmed as a single take, and those slow, tracking shots are a large part of why this film is so successful. The camera refuses to blink, and it zeroes in on its two main characters as they walk towards the end, like two halves of a broken heart, hoping nobody sees the glue that holds them together.<\/p>","post_date":"2017-02-16 10:00:00","post_title":"Vows","post_name":"vows","background_image":"\/\/static.shortoftheweek.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Vows-5-copy.jpg","categories":{"count":4,"limit":10,"page":1,"total":0,"page_max":0,"_links":{"first":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1","last":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","next":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","previous":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1"},"data":[{"ID":95,"color":"#FF7559","display_name":"Drama","slug":"drama"},{"ID":194,"color":"#58B08B","display_name":"Family","slug":"family"},{"ID":684,"color":"#C28800","display_name":"Israel","slug":"israel"},{"ID":64,"color":"#D9B800","display_name":"Live-Action","slug":"live-action"}]},"author":{"display_name":"Adam Banks","first_name":"Adam","last_name":"Banks","ID":"2604","subscriptions":["the-short-list"],"company":"Short of the Week","occupation":"Intern","phone":"5135517298","notification_weekly":"1","notification_daily":"1","notification_texts":null,"email":"adam@shortoftheweek.com","real_name":"Adam Banks"},"country":{"ID":684,"color":"#C28800","display_name":"Israel","slug":"israel"},"filmmaker":"Tal Zagreba","labels":"","links":[{"url":"http:\/\/www.talzagreba.com\/","label":"Filmmaker&#039;s Site"}],"duration":"14","genre":{"ID":95,"color":"#FF7559","display_name":"Drama","slug":"drama"},"play_link":"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/139576681","play_link_target":"video","post_excerpt":"Amos arrives home to tell his wife that he is leaving her, and steps into his own surprise vows renewal party.

Colton\u2019s solution is to invite a third person into their bedroom to spice things up, but it doesn\u2019t all quite go as planned (as is often the case when realising one\u2019s fantasies). What follows is a series of painfully uncomfortable moments between the three, reflecting the adage \u2018be careful what you wish for\u2019, or in this case, \u2018be careful if you ask your girlfriend to have sexual intercourse with another man, whilst you watch and masturbate\u2019 (note my use of biological terminology in order to make this description as appropriate and unsexy as possible). \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p><p>There\u2019s a wealth of information available if you want to learn more about what this particular erotic fantasy entails (a book titled Sperm Wars sounds particularly intriguing) but you get the gist of it. Rather than focusing on the ins and outs of cuckolding, Tyree investigates the possible consequences of partaking in someone else\u2019s sexual fantasy, and how this might affect your relationship. The film is an intimate exploration of the subject, which takes the audience on an absorbing journey through the emotional spectrum.<\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>\u201cLife can be funny. And sad. And unbearably awkward. So can relationships. We hope our little film serves as a reminder of all of these\u201d<\/em>, Tyree explains and he manages to do just that,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> making the short at once personal and universal.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whilst it\u2019s hugely entertaining, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CUCK<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is not without its flaws. The male actors\u2019 performances feel a bit stiff at times and technically speaking I wasn\u2019t entirely sold on the sex scene. However Rachel Alig, who plays Emily does an excellent job of portraying her character and is so convincing that you can\u2019t help but empathise with her. Ultimately however, it\u2019s Tyree\u2019s ability to insert humour into the most inappropriate moments (the words \u2018I\u2019m gonna go in now...\u2019 spring to mind), is what makes <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CUCK<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so hard to watch, but even harder to look away from. <\/span><\/p>","post_date":"2017-02-15 10:00:00","post_title":"CUCK","post_name":"cuck","background_image":"\/\/static.shortoftheweek.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Still-2.jpg","categories":{"count":4,"limit":10,"page":1,"total":0,"page_max":0,"_links":{"first":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1","last":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","next":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","previous":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1"},"data":[{"ID":95,"color":"#FF7559","display_name":"Drama","slug":"drama"},{"ID":64,"color":"#D9B800","display_name":"Live-Action","slug":"live-action"},{"ID":92,"color":"#0AC7C7","display_name":"Sexuality","slug":"sexuality"},{"ID":63,"color":"#58B08B","display_name":"USA","slug":"usa"}]},"author":{"display_name":"Serafima Serafimova","first_name":"Serafima","last_name":"Serafimova","ID":"16227","subscriptions":[],"company":"","occupation":"","phone":"","notification_weekly":null,"notification_daily":null,"notification_texts":null,"email":"serafima@shortoftheweek.com","real_name":"Serafima Serafimova"},"country":{"ID":63,"color":"#58B08B","display_name":"USA","slug":"usa"},"filmmaker":"Adam Tyree","labels":["ma"],"links":[{"url":"http:\/\/www.adamtyree.com","label":"Filmmaker&#039;s Website"}],"duration":"8","genre":{"ID":95,"color":"#FF7559","display_name":"Drama","slug":"drama"},"play_link":"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/169620695","play_link_target":"video","post_excerpt":"When Emily and Colton's relationship hits the rocks, they invite a 3rd party into the bedroom to spice things up.","production":"","style":{"ID":64,"color":"#D9B800","display_name":"Live-Action","slug":"live-action"},"subscriptions":false,"tags":{"count":0,"limit":10,"page":1,"total":0,"page_max":0,"_links":{"first":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1","last":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","next":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","previous":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1"},"data":[]},"text_color":"light","twitter_text":"CUCK+by%C2%A0Adam+Tyree+%7C+%C2%A0Short+Film","thumbnail":"\/\/static.shortoftheweek.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Still-2-640x271.jpg","type":"video","topic":{"ID":92,"color":"#0AC7C7","display_name":"Sexuality","slug":"sexuality"}},{"ID":27774,"post_author":"19","post_content":"<p>On it's surface,\u00a0<em>Does Love Last Forever?\u00a0<\/em>by\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.gluesociety.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Glue Society's<\/a> Pete Baker plays like a traditional love-story - boy meets girl, they fall in love, the live happily(ish) ever after.

Few scenarios can get steam shooting out of my ears like witnessing a decent person\u00a0struggling in vain against Kafkaesque authority. Serena Dykman applies this setup to the often nightmarish US Immigration system in a portrait of a woman with a perfect life awaiting her\u2014if only she can get out of the airport.\u00a0<\/p><p>After a stint in Uganda providing medical aide, attractive Czech doctor Anna (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.imdb.com\/name\/nm6577324\/\">Jandra Dee<\/a>) is detained after her flight back to the US. What she imagines to be a\u00a0routine stop however morphs into an hours-long ordeal, as officers shuffle in and out, and her interrogators vacillate between disinterest and aggressive accusations. Tiny discrepancies regarding violations of the terms of her h-1b visa, and the length of her stay in the US between school semesters, are presented as glaring proof of her malign intent.\u00a0<\/p><p>While there is an interesting contrast\u00a0between Anna and the dehumanizing posture of the immigration officers who amiably discuss their after-work plans while Anna is kept from\u00a0one of the most consequential moments of her own life, Dykman's depiction of the enforcement officials is more an indictment of the unyielding nature of a system that ignores empathy or nuance. Anna is a model immigrant: highly skilled, completely assimilated, with a secure job, and a longterm boyfriend. After 6 years in the country building a life, Anna finds the idea that she doesn't belong to be absurd. But, as the film progresses and the precariousness of her position becomes more apparent, she\u00a0must reckon with questions that she had not needed to confront for a long time\u2014where is Home?<\/p><p>The film is crosscut between Anna's interrogations and her boyfriend as he waits outside the airport. Meaning to propose, he has rented out a limo and a string quartet for the occasion. While vital to the film's plot, and effective at providing an extra dimension to the tragedy, because these scenes cannot have independent development outside of the core plot, they do feel a bit superfluous, and could have been trimmed to tighten the\u00a0films runtime. But, for a closed off film such as this, largely taking place in a single location, its fortunes rise or fall with its writing and performances, and fortunately in\u00a0<em>Welcome<\/em>\u00a0both of these elements are strong. Dee, despite a short filmography to her name, is quite good\u00a0in the role of Anna, maintaining a basic stoicism, but exhibiting gradations within it of vulnerability and strength, indignation alongside fear, and Dykman's script builds dread effectively through an all-to-believable escalation.<\/p><p>Immigration is in the news in the USA right now, but while certainly relevant,\u00a0<em>Welcome <\/em>isn't meant to be a\u00a0statement against incipient Nationalism. The film dates from 2015, and is in fact largely drawn from Dykman's own real experiences with the US immigration system, as the filmmaker was born in Paris, and raised between London, Brussels, and New York, before attending NYU Tisch for film school. Despite the parallels between Dykman's and Anna's stories, it feels too cherry-picked to serve as an effective illustration\u00a0of current events. Anna is only in trouble because she left the country to literally save children's lives! That's not to say that it does not have a\u00a0contribution to the moment however. <em>Welcome<\/em> is hopefully effective in spurring\u00a0reflection regarding the concept of home, and of belonging. The\u00a0law has final stay on status, but status has nothing in common with the web of relationships that make a person of a place: one's work, one's friends, one's lovers.<\/p><p>Anna's exceptional\u00a0nature feels like stacking the deck to prove a point, but in doing so puts lie to the notion that anything about immigration in America is haphazard. Many apologists for recent refugee ban note that it is temporary, a chance to review \"vetting\". Yet in making this case they fail to note a single critique of the extant system, one in which refugees go through a multi-year interview process overseen in collaboration with over a dozen agencies, and, are handpicked from the start by government officials from millions of applicants registered with the U.N. If Anna, a young, educated white woman from Europe, can be subject to such nitpicking, what hope is there for anyone?<\/p><p>Dykman had a good deal of success with\u00a0<em>Welcome\u00a0<\/em>at festivals, even winning a student film prize at Cannes.

Chantelle is instantly equated with a friend or an acquaintance, and thus Lamba is able to direct our perverse fascination in profound directions, provoking interesting questions: would<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I think less of Chantelle if she wasn\u2019t attractive?

Could I be so cruel as to show it to others, plaguing this poor woman that much more? And why would that be wrong? After all, she did post those images of her face post-attack.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Ultimately, Lamba begs us to ask how much everyone\u2014the attacker, the victim, and the followers - all interconnect to become responsible for causing such a downward spiral in an individual. It also reveals the ugly side of how we project ourselves on social media and the rather taboo fact that women are pressured to look \u2018attractive\u2019 on their accounts or else suffer the consequences of being a social pariah.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lamba elaborates: <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was intrigued by the marketability of atrocity.

Yes, <em>Follow Me<\/em> is a mockumentary...but it\u2019s a damn funny one, providing prescient social commentary as well as consistent laughs. Featuring Mad TV alum, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/WillSasso?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Will Sasso<\/a>, and a slew of other recognizable faces, the film skewers our cultural preoccupation with social media culture\u2014a collective obsession over likes, retweets, and other pointless signifiers of digital affection. Is the point that <em>Follow Me<\/em> making novel? No. Not really\u2014rarely a day goes by without some \u201chot-take\u201d think piece about the dangers of social media addiction. But, the comedy feels fresh enough to make it all still work.<\/p>\r\n<p>Sasso, who co-wrote the script with director <a href=\"http:\/\/www.marshallcook.com\/\">Marshall Cook<\/a>, is at the top is his game here. He plays the clueless protagonist: an everyday dad who\u2019s just trying to keep up with the \u201ckids\u201d and be as \u201con fleek\u201d as he can. His on-camera enthusiasm is both infectious and excruciatingly awkward. As a result, despite his boorish attempts to gain digital affection (from preying on his daughter\u2019s misfortune to stealing his wife\u2019s jokes), you just sort of feel sorry for him. He\u2019s a pathetic anti-hero\u2014worthy of simultaneous sympathy and scorn. That\u2019s what makes <em>Follow Me<\/em> work\u2014director Cook understands the inherent empathy of this character: he just wants to be loved. Really, don\u2019t we all want that? So, despite the film\u2019s over-the-top shenanigans, the core sentiment of this character rings true and resonates. Not, bad for a film with pithy one-liners and sketch-like satire.<\/p>\r\n<p>As Cook relates in his filmmaker\u2019s statement: \u201cSocially, the internet is still the wild west. We hope that our protagonist allows viewers to look closely at how they and the people around them, that they know in real life, use social media.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Shot over the course of weekend with a small crew, a couple 5Ds, and a GoPro, <em>Follow Me<\/em> was a quick, small-scale production. It proves that sometimes all it takes to succeed in the short form is some solid actors and a breezy, funny script. Cook, who cut his teeth on commercial competitions on the crowd-sourced site, <a href=\"https:\/\/tongal.com\/\">Tongal<\/a> (he has been awarded \u201cTongaler of the Year\u201d and was later inducted into the their hall of fame) is clearly a talent to watch. He is currently hard at work on other projects. We hope to watch, like, and share\u00a0more of his *ahem* content soon!<\/p>","post_date":"2017-02-09 10:00:00","post_title":"Follow Me","post_name":"follow-me","background_image":"\/\/static.shortoftheweek.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/FollowMe.jpg","categories":{"count":6,"limit":10,"page":1,"total":0,"page_max":0,"_links":{"first":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1","last":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","next":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","previous":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1"},"data":[{"ID":98,"color":"#6795A6","display_name":"Comedy","slug":"comedy"},{"ID":64,"color":"#D9B800","display_name":"Live-Action","slug":"live-action"},{"ID":87,"color":"#FF0059","display_name":"Society","slug":"society"},{"ID":921,"color":"#D69637","display_name":"Submission","slug":"submission-collection"},{"ID":1098,"color":"#B57987","display_name":"Technology","slug":"technology-topic"},{"ID":63,"color":"#58B08B","display_name":"USA","slug":"usa"}]},"author":{"display_name":"Ivan Kander","first_name":"Ivan","last_name":"Kander","ID":"45","subscriptions":["the-short-list"],"company":"Lucky 9 Studios, LLC","occupation":"Filmmaker\/Motion Designer","phone":"703-727-4362","notification_weekly":null,"notification_daily":null,"notification_texts":"1","email":"ikander@gmail.com","real_name":"Ivan Kander"},"country":{"ID":63,"color":"#58B08B","display_name":"USA","slug":"usa"},"filmmaker":"Marshall Cook","labels":"","links":[{"url":"http:\/\/www.marshallcook.com\/","label":"Filmmaker Website"}],"duration":"12","genre":{"ID":98,"color":"#6795A6","display_name":"Comedy","slug":"comedy"},"play_link":"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/203286621","play_link_target":"video","post_excerpt":"A stay-at-home dad and self-proclaimed \"internet celebrity\" ignores an obvious addiction to social media, and attention from strangers, while embarrassing his family with his cringeworthy behavior and the hack \"content\" he creates.","production":"Convoy Entertainment","style":{"ID":64,"color":"#D9B800","display_name":"Live-Action","slug":"live-action"},"subscriptions":false,"tags":{"count":0,"limit":10,"page":1,"total":0,"page_max":0,"_links":{"first":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1","last":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","next":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=0","previous":"https:\/\/www.shortoftheweek.com\/?limit=10&page=1"},"data":[]},"text_color":"light","twitter_text":"Follow+Me+by%C2%A0Marshall+Cook+%7C+Mockumentary+Short+Film","thumbnail":"\/\/static.shortoftheweek.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/FollowMe-640x360.jpg","type":"video","topic":{"ID":87,"color":"#FF0059","display_name":"Society","slug":"society"}}]}
