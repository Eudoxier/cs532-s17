Almost everybody does it... embrace it! Below are some awesome Netflix shows to obsess over.1. Stranger ThingsFans of the The X-Files or any other show involving the supernatural will love Stranger Things  right away. Personally, I think one of the most interesting things about it is that most of the main cast are kids that aren't even in high school yet. The younger cast keeps the show light and fun, as opposed to other shows that can get a little drama- heavy when there is an older cast.Not only that, but the first season is only eight episodes and keeps you involved/interested in the biggest mystery-- where is Will Byers???2. Black MirrorOriginally a British show that was picked up by Netflix, Black Mirror is another series any sci-fi lover would lose their mind over. It doesn't have a continuous plot, so each episode deals with a different set of characters that deal with their own separate and extremely gritty problems. According to the show's IMDB page, the series shows the dark side of life and technology.3. FriendsIt is a classic that everyone can relate to. Need I say more?4. Mushi-shiWhenever I watch Musi-shi, I can't help but feel at ease. It is an anime that follows a man named Ginko who travels as he investigates and helps people who may be having issues with "mushi"-- primeval bodies of life.The animation in this show is gorgeous and the stories are nothing but original.5. Attack on TitanA much more intense and violent anime, Attack on Titan is based on a manga of the same name the tells the story of how humanity survives by trapping themselves inside monstrous walls. What are they trying to stay away from? Titans-- monstrous humanoid creatures that eat humans for fun. The story focuses on Eren Yeager and his friends, as well as the rest of humanity, as they struggle to survive after the monsters have breached their walls and learn that there are more to the titans than meets the eye. Also, long- time fans, rejoice! The long awaited second season is on its way!
6. ShamelessI, personally, have never watched this Shameless, but I feel like it's all anyone ever talks about anymore. From what I understand, it is very explicit and holds nothing back. It focuses on the six children of a perpetual drunk as they cope with their father's mistakes.I'll admit, Lip Gallagher is also pretty cute. 7. The Walking DeadAn all-time favorite of my own (I could never leave it off the list) is The Walking Dead. It really isn't your average zombie show! Unlike most zombie-esque shows/movies, the zombies are only the supporting cast. The real story is in how the survivors band together and inevitably become each others' families after they've lost most of their own. Definitely a tear- jerker.8. Jessica JonesOne of the many Marvel shows on Netflix, Jessica Jones follows sneaky and determined private investigator Jessica Jones, as she helps those in Hell's Kitchen, but also as she fights the demons of her own supernatural origin story.
