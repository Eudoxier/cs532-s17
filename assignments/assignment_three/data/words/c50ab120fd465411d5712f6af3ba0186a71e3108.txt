 The PersonA. R. Bernard (born, 10 August 1953) is the Founder, Senior Pastor and CEO of Christian Cultural Center (CCC) located in Brooklyn, New York, United States. CCC is a ministry and not-for-profit 501c(3) organization, that currently has over 33,000+ members and sits on an 11.5-acre (45,000 m2) campus. He is also the President of the Council of Churches of the City of New York representing 1.5 million Protestants, Anglicans and Orthodox Christians. He sits on the NYC Economic Development Corporation Board, served on NYC School Chancellor’s Advisory Cabinet and Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s 2001 Transition Team.







Spiritual LeaderIn 1990 while the ministry continued to grow, Bernard was asked to serve on the Board of Directors for the Christian Men’s Network (CMN) to help restructure the organization. During his six years on the board, CMN grew to an organization with 74 international offices and with a presence in approximately 150 nations. In addition to serving as Treasurer for the board, Bernard was one of their most requested speakers. With the passing of Dr. Edwin Louis Cole in 2002 he became the President of CMN. Under his leadership, CMN has been reborn as ICB, International Christian Brotherhood.







Life CoachBernard is also the founder of Brooklyn Preparatory School in New York City and Cultural Arts Academy Charter School. Formed in 1993, BPS is a premiere early education institution dedicated to serving young children, ages 3–6. Their June 1999 first grade graduates ranked 91st in the national percentile in reading and 96th in the national percentile in mathematics







CEOBernard left his 10-year banking career in 1979 to go into ministry full time. As the bible study group grew, so did the need for a facility. The Bernard's took their savings and rented a small storefront in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn. Later that year Household of Faith Ministries was incorporated. In 1988, Household of Faith purchased and renovated an abandoned Brooklyn supermarket into a 1000 seat sanctuary, complete with administrative offices and a bookstore. Household of Faith was renamed Christian Life Center and formally moved into its property in June 1989 with a membership of 625.

Further GrowthAs Christian Life Center began experiencing exponential growth - four Sunday services, lines forming at 4:00am, and overflow rooms filled to capacity, the ministry was quickly outgrowing its home on Linden Boulevard. The need for a larger facility was evident and in 1995 a vacant lot adjacent to Starrett City was purchased and construction followed immediately. On December 31, 2000, under the leadership of Bernard, Christian Cultural Center took its new name and moved into its new home. The 6.5-acre (26,000 m2) sanctuary and conference center also includes a chapel, bookstore and state of the art youth center. Christian Cultural Center is one of the largest independent churches in the tri-state area, exemplifies a new paradigm in the worship experience. Bernard remains a highly sought after speaker, teacher and community leader. He has traveled extensively throughout the United States and internationally addressing religious organizations, businessmen and political dignitaries. Future expansion and development is anticipated on a 4.5-acre (18,000 m2) of land adjacent to the current CCC campus.OutreachOutreach programs under his leadership include a food pantry serving the community, a Prison Ministry, and various city organizations including the New York Police Department's orientation.Honors & Awards• The Ebony Power 100, Ebony Magazine, December 2010/January 2011• Crain’s Business Publication, 2008 25 Leaders Reshaping New York• New York Daily News, 2008, 2007, Most Influential Clergy• New York Post 2008 Most Influential African-American New Yorker• New York Daily News, 2008, 2007, Top 30 Most Influential Black New Yorker• New York Post 2007, Top 30 Most Influential Black New Yorker• Consulate General of Israel in New York 2007, Lifetime Achievement Award• New York Magazine, 2006 One of the City’s Most Influential New Yorkers
