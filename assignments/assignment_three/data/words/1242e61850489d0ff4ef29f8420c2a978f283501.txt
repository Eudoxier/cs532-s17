Republicans would make it easier to steal an election by killing the Election Assistance Commission.

In a little-noticed 6-3 vote today, the House Administration Committee voted along party lines to eliminate the Election Assistance Commission, which helps states run elections and is the only federal agency charged with making sure voting machines can’t be hacked. The EAC was created after the disastrous 2000 election in Florida as part of the Help America Vote Act to rectify problems like butterfly ballots and hanging chads. (Republicans have tried to kill the agency for years.) The Committee also voted to eliminate the public-financing system for presidential elections dating back to the 1970s.

The Real Election Fraud

“It is my firm belief that the EAC has outlived its usefulness and purpose,” said Committee chair Gregg Harper (R-MS), explaining why his bill transfers the EAC’s authority to the Federal Election Commission. 		
Thirty-eight pro-democracy groups, including the NAACP and Common Cause, denounced the vote. “The EAC is the only federal agency which has as its central mission the improvement of election administration, and it undertakes essential activities that no other institution is equipped to address,” says the Brennan Center for Justice.		
This move is particularly worrisome given reports that suspected Russian hackers attempted to access voter-registration systems in more than 20 states during the 2016 election. Moreover, the Presidential Commission on Election Administration set up by President Obama in 2014 outlined an “impending crisis” in voting technology and the Brennan Center found that 42 states used voting machines in 2016 that were at least a decade-old and at risk of failing. The EAC was the agency tasked with making sure these voting systems were both modernized and secure.								


The stakes are higher now than ever. Get The Nation in your inbox. 








The EAC is not a perfect agency. It lacked a quorum of members from 2010 to 2014 and was paralyzed by inaction. Then, last year, its executive director unilaterally approved controversial proof-of-citizenship laws in Kansas, Georgia, and Alabama, which the federal courts subsequently blocked.		
But given the threats to American democracy at this moment, the EAC needs to be strengthened, not replaced.		
It’s particularly ironic that the Trump administration is preparing to launch a massive investigation into nonexistent voter fraud based on the lie that millions voted illegally while House Republicans are shutting down the agency that is supposed to make sure America’s elections are secure. It’s more proof of how the GOP’s real agenda is to make it harder to vote.

This is what happens with "incrementalism."  aside from the oligarchical aspects of it. Over the last 30-40 years, Republikkklans have moved right, and the [un] Democratic Party has moved "to the middle" which is following them to the right - afraid to be called "socialists" or "compassionate" or "peacemaker" because we live in such a violent, patriarchal, imperial, culture, and so proud, and so proud.

There is something to be done: We can audit our elections. My nonprofit tech startup has developed the means to independently audit elections in real time. In the event that discrepancies are found, candidates and civic organizations can go to court to enjoin certification of the results pending the results of forensic investigations. There has never been a way to hold electoral officials and election machine companies accountable; now there is. And we citizens can do it, without asking anyone's permission.

Daniel are you taking action re the millions of blocked votes that G. Palast and others identified in this elections GOP electoral states? This elections vote blocking seems to me the most viable action path rather than powerlessly arguing over Trump's staff picks and the multitude of horrific choices.

Yep, after the successful coup d'etat, they are now nominating the cat to guard the milk. 
What do "elections" and "voting" mean, where voting machines are hacked in ten different ways, and our voting in absentee are thrown to the garbage? What kind of 3rd World country have we become? How can there be any hope? 
God have mercy on America!

Wars and conflict make us that way.  I was against the 2001 Afghan war, because I knew that it was the beginning of what we have now, although at the time 90% of the country saw it as just a posse going after the bin Laden gang.

It is interesting to note that it was the Executive Director of the EAC who approved those﻿ proof-of-citizenship laws in Kansas, Georgia and Alabama. It seems to me that it should have been the EAC Election Commissioners. Looking at the EAC website there are 3 commissioners in place right now and by the law that created the EAC there are to be 4 commissioners in all, two from each political party.

Lie, cheat and steal.  That is what they do best.  It is the only way you explain Congress with a 9% approval rating and yet they continue to win.  Lie, cheat and steal.    How much more venal can this get?   Much!!!

The phrase Bernie Sanders used often was "Political Revolution"...and was criticized by many who felt this term was "a little much".  Well, how about now?  We must fight back the right wing extremists and political militants who are destroying this nation and that WILL take a Revolution.

I have to say, this is discouraging. Not only the end of this agency but the fact that from 2010 to 2014 they had no quorum and seemingly did nothing but approve voter suppression.  Let's say the Trumpeteers didn't abolish it but merely created a quorum of far-right Republican vote suppressors? It seems we are damned on all fronts.  Ideas???

At first glance I was puzzled why the GOP would care about this agency, but after reading about the Hursti Hack on Wikipedia I wonder if they are dependent on hacking to win elections and therefore want to bury any hacking investigations.

At the very least the memory cards used in areas that the votes don't match the exit polls should be checked to see if there were negative values on the card.  This is an amazingly simple hack --no authentication/encryption required to modify the cards.   Vote count at start is 0 because negative (democratic) and positive numbers (republican) sum to 0.

This story needs to be distributed more widely. Our voting rights and security in the next election is so important!

It is clear that the republicans do not believe in democracy. It is also clear that they moved below their often argued meritocracy by voting in a Sec. of Education that has NO qualifications for that position, other than millions of dollar$ to donate. Devos' goal in life is to make the US into  a fundamentalist Christian theocracy and she wants to pursue that by transforming our schools into bible schools.
