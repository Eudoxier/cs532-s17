Hey hey, I'm Sarah Schoengold. 
I'm a design thinker, with interest in urban planning, interaction design and storytelling. By day I'm a product person, working to increase engagement on TED.com. I started at TED working with TED Prize digital initiatives like TEDCity2.0, the School in the Cloud and StoryCorps.me.Outside of work I'm a podcast collector, hiker, kickball captain, and ruthless book club organizer. Both Brooklyn and the Pacific Northwest are home. Talk to me about Cold War history (in Africa), the Chicago Cubs or your family history. Box of Rain, is a blog about design, music and family as I endeavor to archive my dad's record collection.
