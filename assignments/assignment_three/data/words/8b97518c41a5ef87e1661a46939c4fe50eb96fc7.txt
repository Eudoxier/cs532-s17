Welcome to Safe in Warwickshire
Safe in Warwickshire is brought to you by the multi-agency Safer Warwickshire Partnership Board.
Our aim is to reduce crime and disorder and promote safety in Warwickshire by providing support, advice and leadership to our partners and communities.

“Protecting Our Communities Together”

The agencies involved include Warwickshire County Council, Warwickshire Police, Warwickshire Fire & Rescue Service, Warwickshire’s Probation Services, North Warwickshire Borough Council, Nuneaton & Bedworth Borough Council, Rugby Borough Council, Stratford District Council, Warwick District Council, health partners and voluntary sector organisations.
At a local level we work with the four Community Safety Partnerships in Warwickshire which are multi-agency partnerships based in North Warwickshire, Nuneaton and Bedworth, Rugby and South Warwickshire.
We also work closely with the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Warwickshire and other partnerships including the Youth Justice Service, Drug and Alcohol Action Team and Warwickshire Against Domestic Abuse.
We are committed to working together to reduce crime and maintain quality of life for people who live, work and visit Warwickshire.
