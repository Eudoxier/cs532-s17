               Illustrated by

				Welcome to the World of The Thornigans.  Our first book delves deep into the differences between birds and bugs.  A diverse group of children point out that our avian friends are infinitely preferable to insects. . Or are they?   Things are not always that clear cut, so if you are a bug lover, don't bypass this warm and  cheerful book on that account.  Featuring creatures ranging from chickadees and inch worms to a mischievous garden gnome, this peaceful (no one gets eaten) book is a humorous and enjoyable read.  There are 24 pages of color illustrations each with a single line of text for early readers.  Please join us. . But seriously, watch out for that gnome.
