It’s meant to communicate information about a lawmakers’ legislative duties and constituent services, according to the Committee on House Administration.

As Labor Day comes and goes, it can be hard for candidates to peel away from the campaign trail to get back to their day jobs — even if that involves voting as a member of Congress.House members running for a different office, most of whom are seeking promotions to the Senate, have missed about 10 percent more roll call votes this month through Sept. 22 than their colleagues seeking re-election, according to a Roll Call analysis.

Lobbyists and lobbying organizations gave money to former Rep. Chaka Fattah through the end of April of this year, nine months after he was indicted in a racketeering conspiracy that later ended the Pennsylvania Democrat's congressional career, according to contribution disclosures filed with the Senate.In June 2016, a federal jury in Philadelphia convicted Fattah of conspiracy, money laundering and of using campaign funds to pay off his son’s student loans, forcing his resignation from the House.

He also received additional contributions in his name through the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, which he chaired.
