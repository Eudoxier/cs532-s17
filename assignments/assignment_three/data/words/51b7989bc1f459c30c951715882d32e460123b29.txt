Ashani Allick found his calling as a photographer just a year ago, and is creating Paradise with images that resemble movie stills. After making ties with Cinematic Music Group in 2015, Allick has worked with artists like Joey Bada$$, G-Herbo, D.R.A.M, and others, meshing hip-hop photography with documentarian work. Currently, he’s touring with The Smokers Club (featuring Herbo, Cam’ron, and others) across the country.
