Excellent article users participation is ultimately the right solution. Manufacturers need feedback for the industry to progress. The rewards system is a good step in the right direction.
Reaction to viruses or malware after the fact, costly. Proactive approach is better. CEO must combine efforts with a shared commitment. Human habits are inherently lazy or denial only hurt all members in an open network.
The industry needs tools that can be proactive against the darker half that is bent on ego driven, profiteering, nation-state motivated vectors. Manufacturers need support from our own governments supporting policies with backing of three branches: Legislative, Judicial and Executive. 
Anything less is a recipe for disaster. 
Encrytption, cooperation (trust) and acceptance of policies among other things are needed for the bad actor to become less effective, less profitable.

When have cyber criminals EVER fronted that much cash on buying their own hardware? They don't have to. They can simply create a botnet large enough to do it for them. Buying a high-end PC costs upwards of $1,000 but botnets are bought for $5 per zombie on average. This attack is completely feasible if you consider that the most common botnets number in at least 100 systems, though organized cybercriminals have 500, even 1000 zombies under their control. If you believe that just because it has a high price-tag on the hardware necessary to generate a SHA-1 collision that cyber criminals won't try, you're fooling yourself.

The reality is that app vendors and third-parties should have been pushing SHA-2 for years and because they procrastinated this long, it is up to the end-users and organizations that own the assets to make that decision.by Michael Piece on February 14, 2017, 11:59AMSHA-1 End Times Have Arrived
