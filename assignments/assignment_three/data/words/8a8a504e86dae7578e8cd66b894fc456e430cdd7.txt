“Enterprises can no longer sit back and wait for threat data to come to them. The next generation of security challenges requires a more proactive approach to detect and respond to threats that have evaded defensive technologies. I have found Endgame’s Hunt platform helpful in allowing an analyst to quickly detect never-before-visible malicious behaviors on host systems, and block and remove threats in real-time."  

— Ryan Gurr, Information Security Manager at NuScale Power




“Endgame’s platform elevates our tier 1 analysts to operate at a tier 3 level, allowing us to spend less time and resources on incident response and compromise assessment. With Endgame, we can prevent, detect, and proactively hunt advanced attacks at the earliest possible moment, before damage and loss of critical assets.”
 
— Dan Basile, Information Security Officer, Texas A&M




“ The rules of the game have changed.  Organizations are compromised and need to hunt for adversaries in their networks. Endgame’s approach to threat hunting will better equip organizations with the tools necessary to stop advanced adversaries at the earliest stages.” 

— Dr. Eric Cole, Secure Anchor Consulting, Former SANS Instructor
