Jeffrey McDaniel
Executive in Residence
As an Executive in Residence, Jeffrey McDaniel works with the management teams of start-up, clean energy and manufacturing technology companies to identify and to address critical business issues including intellectual property creation and protection, international product development, marketing, sales, fundraising, management recruitment and growth planning.

For a portfolio company, Jeffrey provides mentoring and network access, and serves as an observer on the board of directors.

Prior to joining Innovation Works, Jeffrey was in charge of business development and strategy for the emerging technology R&D portfolio for Westinghouse Electric Company, developing clean energy solutions and products, and providing organizational leadership for technology teams.  He also led the global implementation of new Sustainability technology and innovation design processes.  Before joining Westinghouse, Mr. McDaniel held marketing, strategy, and development roles at the Ex One Company, a global manufacturing technology incubator headquartered in western Pennsylvania. He led the successful commercialization of Imagen, LLC, a manufacturer of dental implant and bio-medical devices through 3D printing, becoming that startup’s General Manager and Vice President. Previously, Jeffrey was an associate at Reed Smith, LLP, where he worked in the law firm’s corporate division and gained M&A, partnership and organizational experience, supporting privately-held and pre- and post-IPO clients. Mr. McDaniel served in the United States Navy as a Surface Warfare Officer where he led sailors in engineering and combat systems roles, as well as joint operations and intelligence teams in the U.S. and throughout Central and South America.
