Welcome to Erasmus  Motaung INC
ABOUT US
Erasmus Motaung Incorporated (“EMI”)  was born out of the merger of two firms, namely Motaung Ngeno and Erasmus Beyl  Incorporated.  Through experience  and its involvement in legal business, EMI is well positioned to bring goodwill  to any alliance or customer they interact with. This is achieved by utilising a  network of different customers and allies in the business to develop better  products and services for our clients.   
The directors of the  firm possess extensive experience in the fields of Conveyancing, Property Law,  Corporate Law, Contract Law, Estate Planning and Administration of  Estates.  Having worked on sophisticated  transactions in both public and the private sector, our firm has accumulated  experience over years and therefore we are aware of the strategies employed by  our competition in relation to legal service delivery, relationship building  techniques and related issues.  As a  result, we strive to ensure that we remain relevant to our clients by keeping  up with all relevant developments that affect or may affect our areas of  expertise. 
VISION
To build a law firm of choice which shall be acknowledged as a meaningful South African law firm and to stand out due to the quality of service and expertise rendered to all our clients.
