 Meredydd Williams Doctoral StudentStudent, Wolfson CollegeE: firstname.lastname@cs.ox.ac.ukRobert Hooke Building,
										 Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PR
										Themes:SecuritySee Also:http://www.meredydd-williams.com/BiographyI am currently studying for a PhD/DPhil in Cyber Security, specifically focusing on privacy and Internet-of-Things devices. I completed my initial Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) year in which I studied the area from a multidisciplinary approach, with modules specialising in security architectures, ethics, data analysis, human factors, criminology, digital forensics and international relations.
I also demonstrate for the Computer Security and Advanced Security practicals: the former specialising in linear and differential cryptanalysis, and the latter concerning steganography and homomorphic encryption. In addition to this, I have tutored the Computer Security Major Tutorial for the Worcester College Visiting Student Programme and the Computer Security Revision Class for the Department of Computer Science. Since November 2016 I am also a Student Ambassador, engaging in outreach activities to encourage prospective students to apply to top-tier universities. Alongside my studies, I am a member of Wolfson College, Cymdeithas Dafydd ap Gwilym (Oxford Welsh Society), and the Oxford University Liberal Democrat Society.
Prior to joining Oxford, I completed an MPhil with Distinction in Advanced Computer Science at Christ's College, University of Cambridge, developing a taxonomy of Denial-of-Service attacks with Dr Robert N M Watson.
I received my undergraduate degree from Aberystwyth University in Wales, completing a First-Class BEng (Hons) in Software Engineering and developing a cryptographic application alongside Prof Reyer Zwiggelaar.
Outside of academia, I have had technical roles in the financial and pharmaceutical sectors.
I also tweet on cybersecurity, privacy and all things technology. Follow me @MeredWilliams.Selected PublicationsView AllManage publications
