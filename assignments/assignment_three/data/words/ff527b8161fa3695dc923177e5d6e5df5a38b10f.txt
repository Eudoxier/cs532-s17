Jeremiah Grossman

Chief of Security Strategy (SentinelOne), Professional Hacker, Black Belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Off-Road Race Car Driver, Founder of WhiteHat Security, and Maui resident.	
				














 










About "Jer"

            	Founder of WhiteHat Security. World-Renowned Professional Hacker. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt. Published Author. Influential Blogger. Off-Road Race Driver.
				

				Jeremiah Grossman's career spans nearly 20 years and has lived a literal lifetime in computer security to become one of the industry's biggest names. And since Jeremiah earned a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt, the media has described him as "the embodiment of converged IT and physical security.” Preventing attacks from the scariest cyber-criminals is all in a day's work for Jeremiah, but staying a keystroke ahead of the bad guys isn't easy. In 2001, Jeremiah founded WhiteHat Security, which today has one of the largest professional hacking armies on the planet. Let it sink in. Professional. Hacker. Army. 
				

				Jeremiah has received a number of industry awards, been publicly thanked by Microsoft, Mozilla, Google, Facebook, and many others for privately informing them of weaknesses in their systems -- a polite way of saying, ‘hacking them'. His research has included new ways to surreptitiously turn on anyone's computer video camera and microphone from anywhere across the Internet, sidestep corporate firewalls, abuse online advertising networks to take any website offline, hijack the email and bank accounts of millions, silently rip out saved passwords and surfing history from web browsers, and many other innovative cyber-attack techniques – some so insidious and fundamental that many still have not been fixed to this day. 
				

				Collectively, it's no surprise Jeremiah has been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, NY Times and hundreds of other media outlets around the world who rely upon his expertise regularly. Just type “Jeremiah Grossman” into your favorite search engine, you'll see.  Of course, all of this was after Mr. Grossman served as information security officer at Yahoo! Being both technical and business savvy, Jeremiah Grossman is the ultimate ‘white hat.'

Life

				This man works hard and plays hard. When not hacking anything and everything, Jeremiah is often engaged in industry groups he founded, mentoring entrepreneurs, participating on a handful of company advisory boards, and racing around a dirt oval, swapping paint in his souped-up Toyota 4-Runner. Jeremiah is also a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt under Professor Luis Heredia at Maui Jiu-Jitsu, regularly trains with pro mixed martial arts fighters, and seeks adrenaline wherever he can find it. In his home life on Maui, Jeremiah is the devoted husband and father of three crazy whiz-kids.
