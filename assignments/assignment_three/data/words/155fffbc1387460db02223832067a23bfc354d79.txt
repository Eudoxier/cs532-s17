In Facebook, from the menu in the top right corener:
          Click "Privacy Settings" -> Blocked People and Apps -> And make sure NetworkedBlogs is not blocked.
Could it be something else in your browser?
As a test, try accessing this page with a different browser.
        If it works, then there's something in your extensions or settings that is causing the issue.
If that doesn't fix it, email us at info@ninua.com.
