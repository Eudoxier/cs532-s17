What Our Customers Are Saying



 









SocialFlow has helped us get a grip on what our social media activity is, establish control in terms of who is doing what when, and, more importantly, it is helping us become more effective as we engage on the social media platforms. 



Ralph Rivera, Director of Digital, BBC








As a news organization that doesn’t sleep — that has content late night, early mornings, weekends, all around the clock —it was really important to our social media strategy to post content in that time. We found that SocialFlow's scheduling and optimization tools are the best way to do that.  



Tara Abell, Social Media Editor,  New York Magazine 








SocialFlow stretches across our business touching both the editorial and the ad sales sides. It's been a solution that allows us to scale what we do from an organic social publishing perspective, but also has allowed us to unlock incremental revenue from advertisers leveraging data we pump through SocialFlow on a daily basis.



Ben Kaplan, Director of Product  and Operations, Time, Inc.








SocialFlow helps our team take the manual labor out of programming our content and empowers them with the time to think proactively about campaign planning and strategy.  



Katie Evans, Marketing Manger,  Edutopia- The George Lucas Educational Foundation 








I want to focus my time on content marketing strategy not the time and delivery of posts. With SocialFlow, rather than making educated guesses, we utilize the platform to have the intelligence drive the posting strategy while we focus on content growth. 



Lorraine Goldberg, Social Media Manager, Allrecipes








SocialFlow is our main publishing platform. Multiple social media editors work in it all day.  It is a great tool for our team.  



Ken Sheldon, Executive Director of Audience Development, New York Media








“SocialFlow does a job that no human could possibly do: It analyzes millions of data points to tell us the best moment to send a message for maximum engagement and click-throughs.”



Dan Strauss, General Manager, The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard








“Optimization makes all the difference – solid results on the organic side, and then we use the analytics to decide which messages to promote further. Our spend goes so much further with SocialFlow.”



Derek Schoen - Director of Interactive Marketing,  ARIA Resort & Casino








SocialFlow allowed us to strengthen our security. We dramatically reduced the number of producers who have direct access to our social media accounts. For me, it meant no more sleepless nights.



Anna Vissens, Audience Analyst, BBC News
