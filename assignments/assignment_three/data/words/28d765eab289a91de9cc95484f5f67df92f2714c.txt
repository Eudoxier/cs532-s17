GO FUND MEOn December 14, 2016, my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had gone into the hospital because of an obstructed bowel and due to an x-ray, they found a spot on her breast. We hadn’t had healthcare or any “extra” money that wasn’t going to food or utilities for years, so she hadn’t had the chance to get annual mammograms. Less than a month later, due to a PET scan, the diagnosis grew from stage 2 breast cancer to stage 4 breast and bone cancer.  After several MRIs and a PET scan, the doctors accessed that she will need a mastectomy after months of chemotherapy.Lisa and I have been struggling financially for years, but have always seemed to get by. Unfortunately, we now need help. She signed up for Obamacare/ACA, but it won’t start until March. The premiums are a bit too high for us, as well, but we will have healthcare for her after March 1, 2017. Since the premium is so high, we won’t be able to eat one week out of every month. As a Social Worker, Lisa has dedicated her whole 30 year career to helping people from abused/neglected children to mentally ill and developmentally disabled, just to name a few. Now, my wife needs the help. With any extra monies we may have left from your generous donations (after medical care and household bills), we pledge to donate to Domestic Violence victims. That has been my wife’s passion for years. Finally, we will donate any additional funding to cancer patients who don’t have healthcare themselves.I have never been one to ask for monies, I’ve worked hard to get by for my whole life. I don’t really even know how to say “help me”, but I guess it’s time to learn. I just need to help my wife, my family.
