Affordable (holiday) wines

'tis the season for the annual value wine list courtesy of the women at House Wine
It's not tacky to gift a bottle of wine under $15 since great value is a gift that keeps giving. (Last year's suggestions still hold too)

To tree or not to tree?

Is fake or real more economical for your budget and the environment? Shiral Tobin goes out on  a limb so you can decide for yourself. Whether you choose the cheap big box choice for $20 at Ikea, a charity lot like Aunt Leah's, or cutting one down (for free, with permit) for yourself on crown land  ,or a Christmas tree farm, you can certainly find something that won't leave you pinched for cash or holiday spirit.   If you plan earlier enough (like November) you can even rent a tree in Vancouver, or have one delivered.  But according to forestry company carbonsync, real trees are more environmentally friendly than artificial. 
Hear why:

money advice for low income earners

Ever notice that most financial advice is geared towards people with money?  So has the Family Services Society of Greater Vancouver which offers a money skills course geared towards low income earners.  It's a four week program in which money-minded facilitators lead group discussions about our relationship to money combined with tools to help you be in control of your money (not the other way around).  Often those of us with less money might not bother with budgets. Hear why that's a mistake:

           OK , we've been talking about being pinched for cash for a long time now, but the message about debt isn't sinking in. Consumer debt is still going up.  Here's some advice from the experts on how to get a handle on it before you get swept up in Black Friday and the holiday shopping frenzy.

Free ocean living

When something is "free" is it too good to be true? Not for some UBC students who skipped paying rent for their final semester while living aboard a boat they got for free on Craigslist.

Upcycle to savings

Making what's old new again is a big trend in design and DIY circles.  Upcycling, or making something better and new by changing it, can cost some money, but when you're looking at the quality of "old" furniture compared to new, you have to consider how much  can be saved over many years.  It's about value. 
 

 
A new store in Vancouver's Gastown called  L'Atelier home is focused on this idea.  You can buy already "upcycled" goods, or bring your old item in to be upcycled. They also buy old furniture you don't want.  Another option is to (donate or) shop Habitat for Humanities re-store.  A listener also contacted me to suggest shopping the auctions.  And if you think antiques may be beyond your bank account, upcyling has also hit the Ikea budget crowd: ever tried Ikea hacking?  The value comes from financial savings, but also from creating something original.

Free costumes

Hallowe'en is an exciting time of year. Young and old embrace the chance to be someone else for a night, but the cost of a new costume or even the supplies to make one can catch you by surprise. Enter Costume Swap Day Canada  this October 13th. Host your own or attend one of the more than a dozen swaps planned in BC.  The idea is simple: bring a costume, leave with a costume and don't pay a thing. Help the environment, build a sense of community and have fun this Hallowe'en without digging deep in your pocket.
