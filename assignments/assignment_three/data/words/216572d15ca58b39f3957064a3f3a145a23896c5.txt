Spiritus PartnersWired for Well-being 



Our Mission Promote Patient Safety and Support Improved Clinical OutcomesInspired by shared value principles, Spiritus Partners is dedicated to promoting patient safety and supporting improved clinical outcomes in the use of medical devices.  Our success is central to the aims of our clients - health systems, device manufacturers, and payers - as well as the interests of patients and regulators.  Patient SafetyMedical devices are increasingly instrumented, interoperable, connected and intelligent.  For patients, providers, device manufacturers, and payers, such advances are a two-edged sword.  With such innovation comes a higher risk of injuries, complications and unnecessary deaths.  In concert, regulators are raising the bar for post-market surveillance and adverse event management by pushing standardized device identifiers and incident reporting databases.  Improved Clinical OutcomesIn a value-based setting, improved clinical outcomes and population health are at the forefront of key stakeholders' interests and activities.  From risk-adjusted inpatient mortality, inpatient safety, and prevention at the hospital level to patient-level demographics, socioeconomics, lifestyle, co-morbidities and utilization factors, attribution is complex and outcomes are highly variable. And while device design, manufacturing, malfunction, and security issues may be contributing factors, other causes such as medical complications, body rejection phenomenon, allergic reactions, surgical techniques, and user errors all may come into play as contributors to poor outcomes or adverse events involving medical devices.Our CommitmentAt Spiritus Partners, we understand the issues.  And we're committed to accelerating change across the ecosystem through our secure, cloud-based device registry, chain of custody, and advanced analytics solutions.  We're marshalling a combination of proven enterprise-class software and promising emergent technologies - from the point of care to the points of accountability and control.  We're driven to deliver cost-effective, complementary solutions that leverage existing infrastructure and initiatives to make a difference - for patients, providers and payers.
