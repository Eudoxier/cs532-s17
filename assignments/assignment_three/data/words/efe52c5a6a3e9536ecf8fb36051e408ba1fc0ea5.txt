I don't understand. OpenSSH = SSH daemon; Dropbear = SSH daemon
Did he meant SCP for Dropbear or SFTP for OpenSSH, or ???

permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply[–]qwertyoruiop 20 points21 points22 points 9 days ago (1 child)to be fair openssh is also a client. maybe this only installs the client? i dunno

permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply[–]Anomalous11iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 3 points4 points5 points 9 days ago (17 children)No. Dropbear works fine and you can already get SFTP/SCP with some hacking. This is pointless.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]taylorbasedswagiPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 10 points11 points12 points 9 days ago (5 children)Assuming it allows sftp over wifi, why is it pointless? Just because it takes something that is already possible and makes it more convenient?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]derpherp128iPhone 5S, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (4 children)Because the combination of SFTP for dropbear + Wifi SSH already do the same thing.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]vipzeniPhone 5S, iOS 10.2 2 points3 points4 points 9 days ago (10 children)How? Every tutorial I've seen is confusing as hell.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Anomalous11iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago* (9 children)I wrote a tutorial for this but it got removed:
https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/5qu3xw/tutorial_how_to_get_sftp_on_ios_102_with/
I can copy and paste it to you if it doesn't show up. To SSH into your phone use usbmuxd or ifunbox.
Edit: a letter

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Trencheel303 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (8 children)could you post it please? it must have been removed. You can SSH via terminal but I noticed pretty soon after that you can't use something like cyberduck. I'd quite like to be able to.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Anomalous11iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (7 children)Pasted below (if this also gets removed, I'll pm it to you):
For those who don't know, OpenSSH is no longer being included due to issues it has with iOS 10.X. Qwertyoruiop included an alternative, a lightweight SSH
Daemon known as Dropbear; however, Dropbear does not come with an SFTP server.
SFTP is a method of interacting with your device's filesystem, much like FTP but via SSH (significantly more secure). I mainly use it to upload ringtones and other media, as well as download recordings, but it can be used for anything from editing files locally to pulling logs down to your main system. Until a package is created to remedy this, here are the steps I took to get SFTP back on iOS 10.2. For reference, I'm running Yalu102 Alpha on an iPhone 6S. I don't take responsibility for devices being bricked or bootlooped; only embark on this if you know what you're doing.

From the Cydia/Telesphoreo repo, download APT 0.7 Strict. You must get the version that only says strict, not the lib (although the lib should install later). This will allow us to use apt-get over SSH.
Connect to your device via SSH. If you haven't changed your password yet, the default username is 'root' and the password is 'alpine'. MTerminal may also work, though I have never used it.
NOTE: It's beyond the scope of this tutorial, but you should take immediate steps to secure your SSHD if you have not already. This is critical!
The following steps will involve typing commands into the terminal. I try my best to explain what each one does, but be mindful that you get these correct.
Download OpenSSH: apt-get install openssh
Copy the SFTP-server executable that OpenSSH installs to another directory, such as the root directory: cp /usr/libexec/sftp-server /var/root/
Remove OpenSSH. This is the most important step here: if you do not remove OpenSSH, you will no longer have access to the SSH server next time you jailbreak, PERIOD. Type: apt-get remove openssh
Move your previously copied sftp-server executable back to the /usr/libexec directory: mv /var/root/sftp-server /usr/libexec/
Reboot your device: reboot
Rejailbreak and enjoy SFTP!

Let me know if this works for anyone who desperately wanted SFTP back. Good luck!

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Trencheel303 1 point2 points3 points 8 days ago (1 child)Thanks. You say you are running yalu102 alpha, things may have changed now with beta 7? I said above I could ssh using terminal but not use sftp/scp (so gui utilities like cyberduck were out). That was on beta 3; now on beta 7 ssh is acting altogether like it is disabled as I can't ssh from terminal on my Mac and if I try from the iPhone it says ssh doesn't exist. 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Anomalous11iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago* (0 children)Indeed, this tutorial was written a week or so ago when the only thing out was Alpha. To get wifi access, you'll need to follow this tutorial
And to get SFTP/SSH over USB, this should help you along.
Sorry for the confusion! At least once you set this sort of thing up it's "set it and forget it". Good luck.
Edit: Note that my initial tutorial is also necessary. Neither of the links will give you SFTP capabilities, they merely allow you to connect to the server itself via one way or another.

Connect to your device via SSH.

Thats the problem, I always get “Connection refused”.
Perhaps because the latest betas no longer allow SSH access over wifi. I dont know how to connect via USB…

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]taylorbasedswagiPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (4 children)Yeah but that's only over usb unless you change the dropbear.plist. I'm assuming this just makes it so you don't have to edit that plist. Ssh/sftp will just be enabled by default.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]drake90001 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (3 children)Yes it will and anyone can access it remotely then. Luca didn't disable it over wifi just for fun. It was for a reason. Not to mention a USB connection will transfer files much faster and reliably than a wifi connection. 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]taylorbasedswagiPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 6 points7 points8 points 9 days ago (1 child)Anyone can't access if your passwords are changed. Luca's concern is legitimate but everyone should be able to decide for themselves since it's their device. Personally, I'm okay with the risk for the convenience. I'd rather not have to plug in my device or even have it on my person (just on the same network) to transfer files. The speed difference is negligible for me. 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]gangtraet 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)Luca had to close it since the default password is known. Once you have changed it, ssh over wifi shouls be safe.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]BWA_DallasiPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)I'm assuming the "OpenSSH for DropBear" means enabling wifi connectivity as well.

permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply[–]Carlyd95iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (1 child)Does this fix git? or allow you to run ssh-keygen? Cause that's what I want!

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]candoizoDeveloper 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)Pretty sure all this does is enable "open"(meaning free/less restricted, as opposed to the same word used in "OpenSSH") SSH access over wifi for Dropbear, kinda awkwardly worded tweet but should be useful for anyone who doesn't wanna go editing the plist

I submitted OpenSSH for dropbear to BigBoss repo.

What?!? OpenSSH and Dropbear are two entirely different SSH Daemons. How does one submit "OpenSSH for Dropbear"? Unless they meant SFTP/SCP, in which case this has already been done, repeatedly for 10.2.
Not sure why this is even worthy of a news post.

permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply[–]Russianwaff13[S] -1 points0 points1 point 9 days ago (26 children)Because dropbear is only over USB, and OpenSSh is over wifi? And coolstars tweaks still requires you to manually modify the dropbear.plist on every reboot this I imagine won't. That makes it more useful for the basic user who doesn't want to edit a plist. 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]nullpixelDeveloper 5 points6 points7 points 9 days ago (3 children)
Because dropbear is only over USB

no, just no.
Luca chose to make it USB only

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]vipzeniPhone 5S, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (2 children)OK, so how to chance that in a correct and reliable way, please? Every tutorial looks confusing and just a dirty hack.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]IAMA_LION_AMADeveloper 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (1 child)Open the yalu source code in Xcode, open dropbear.plist, change '127.0.0.1:22' to '22', install on your phone. Now you'll always have wifi SSH enabled when re-jailbreaking.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]vipzeniPhone 5S, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)Wow, so I need to have Xcode and recompile the application? Thanks, but I was hoping for a tweak or something simple for simple users.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Gb160 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (5 children)I already made a tool that acheives this, my tool doesn't touch the usb only instance of dropbear which runs as default, it starts another instance on port 2222 which is available over wifi/3g/4g, also includes sftp/scp. If anyone wants to try my repo is :
http://gb160.github.io/
Note, tool is called simplesftp-yalu...a different version is available for Yalu and Mixtape/HomeDepot jailbreak.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]derpherp128iPhone 5S, iOS 10.2 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (1 child)Q: what does this do differently than WiFi SSH / SFTP for dropbear? Does it just consolidate it into one?

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Gb160 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (0 children)Yep, with scp as well...just note it uses port 2222, as i didn't want to change the default (usb only) instance which already uses port 22.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]marksolomon32iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 10.1.1 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (2 children)Have you tested it on 10.1.1 or will it only work with 10.2. I don't know how different the dropbear Dameon is between the two. I have devices on 10.1.1 and 10.2.

[–]marksolomon32iPhone 7 Plus, iOS 10.1.1 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)Actually, I went ahead and looked at it and saw that it's already configured I just needed to load it. I then made bash scripts for turning it on and off. Pretty easy actually I was over thinking it. Thanks though. Now I just run
sshon

to turn it on and
sshoff

to turn it off.

permalinkembedsavereportgive goldreply[–]Anomalous11iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (15 children)Still doesn't answer what "OpenSSH for Dropbear" means.
Also, Dropbear is not limited to USB as you imply; it's a choice that was consciously made by /u/qwertyoruiop. If you can't run usbmuxd or another client to get SSH or change it to work over wifi by yourself, you probably shouldn't really be running a network-facing SSH daemon at all.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Russianwaff13[S] 1 point2 points3 points 9 days ago (8 children)I have no idea what it means we will know once it's released. And I know dropbear isn't limited to USB but what I'm saying is basic users are still going to want it this makes it easier for them if it does what I think it does (ssh over wifi) and that's the main thing. 

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]BrunoNFLDeveloper 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (7 children)Well, there are many of those tools already released that enable the Wi-Fi access for dropbear (including one of my own haha) and I don't know if this name will be allowed by Optimo. We'll see

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Russianwaff13[S] 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (6 children)Yes but your tweak doesn't work I just test it, with a reboot on a spare device and nothing works.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Anomalous11iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (3 children)You can still ssh-keygen and place keys in a .authorized_keys file with Dropbear. I'm doing it right now.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Carlyd95iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (2 children)I took a leap of faith and just assumed open ssh daemon is what's broken, so I'm just using the binaries from the deb, ssh and ssh-keygen, working fine. Don't think it would mess anything up. At least I hope not

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Anomalous11iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (1 child)Yeah, you're right. The daemon is what's broken; importing sftp-server, scp and ssh-keygen won't cause any problems as far as I know.

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]Carlyd95iPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 8 days ago (0 children)Sweet, I don't know why he didn't just add those in. I don't think a lot of people know that it's only the server

permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply[–]taylorbasedswagiPhone 6s, iOS 10.2 0 points1 point2 points 9 days ago (0 children)Says who? It's more convenient to install a package that automatically enables sftp over wifi automatically than it is to manually do it. Just because someone doesn't want to manually do it doesn't mean they can't.
And even if they couldn't do it manually, whether they should or should not have this convenience is up to them. It's their device.
