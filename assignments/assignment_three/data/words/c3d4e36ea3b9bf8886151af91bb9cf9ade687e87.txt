Why do so many schools use ClassCharts?

        Due to the success of the PBIS program and the ease of Class Charts, our suspension rate decreased over 3% this past school year.

        Class Charts also made the PBIS program successful by making our “reward system” accessible and easy to use for teachers and students. Teachers were able to create their own rewards for their classroom, providing constant opportunities for student to use their points.  Students also could easy purchase tickets to our monthly rewards, making it easier for the PBIS team to determine which students would be attending the events.

        I tried using Class Charts to help with my seating arrangements. I have large classes and need to make adjustments to the seating arrangements but hate having to do it in excel. The Class Charts make VERY easy for me to instant changes. The students appreciate being able to come into class and look at the screen and know where to go without having to wait for me to tell them. One easy step. Thanks for helping to make my teaching day run a little smoother!!

        The behaviour management feature is my favorite option within Class Charts. I use this feature daily with my students to keep them on task. I like having the ability to reward positive behaviours and redirect undesired behaviours. Not only does this allow my students to stay on task, they can visually see their progress and earnings on my Smartboard. Reinforcing positive behaviour through the visuals and sound effects that are offered have truly made a difference in my students' behaviour!

        I use it to keep track of homework, class participation, behaviour and classroom management. I am able to project the chart through Apple TV onto one of the class' boards which really helps with classroom management

        I use it for extrinsic motivation through gamification of the classroom. Students earn points for positive behaviour and for meeting classroom expectations. Students level-up after they earn a specific number of points. Each time they level up they receive a reward from jelly beans to a choice of where they sit in class.

        I have just begun to use it as a classroom management tool. I have tried something similar for many years on paper, with only limited success. I'm VERY excited about finding you and love the interface so far. I need to buy a tablet so that I can do this while moving around the room.

        I love the ability to keep a record of student attendance and behaviour throughout the year. I also enjoy being able to communicate with parents about attendance and behaviour daily. This tool truly helps to track, monitor and communicate student progress in a very efficient way. I would be lost without this wonderful tool!

        I like the ease of use. Uploading students is simple and so is adding behaviours and making a seating chart. Although there is not a tablet app as of now, I still prefer ClassCharts over other similar applications. ClassCharts has many more features, including the AI function.

        Customisable behaviours, analytics, student access. Its pretty perfect. If I think of anything that I need that you can add for future versions, I'll send you a note. I intend to use it every day next year and have already begun my preparations. Thanks!
