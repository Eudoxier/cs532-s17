                           Undergraduate
                           




The Undergraduate College offers twenty-four majors, and a number of pre-professional,
                                 certification, and special programs like honors, three-year bachelors, five-year masters,
                                 and seven-year BA/MD to help students reach their professional and personal goals.
                                 With in-depth study of a particular area, as well as the breadth of study in the liberal
                                 arts, exceptional faculty, non-traditional learning experiences,  and a focus on post-graduate
                                 success, our students find themselves well-prepared to face the challenges they will
                                 encounter in their careers and their lives.
                              






                           Graduate
                           




Earning a master’s degree takes dedication— by student, faculty, and institution alike.
                                 Rosemont is committed to offering our students the best graduate education available
                                 by hiring the most qualified instructors, those who are at the top of their game professionally,
                                 delivering online and traditional classes, and presenting unique learning experiences
                                 beyond what’s typical of graduate schools. From a double degree to global studies
                                 to a variety of professional certifications, Rosemont embraces the POWER of small
                                 to ensure the success of all our students.
                              






                           Professional Studies
                           




The decision to pursue an undergraduate degree as an adult, whether starting or completing
                                 it, isn’t always simple. There are full-time jobs, families, and so many other responsibilities
                                 to consider. Rosemont’s School of Professional Studies offers flexibility and convenience
                                 in their accelerated undergraduate programs to address those challenges facing adult
                                 learners. Opportunities, connections, and an exceptionally personalized education
                                 from industry leaders is what the POWER of small is all about.
