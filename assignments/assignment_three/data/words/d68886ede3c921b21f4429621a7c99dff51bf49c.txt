KXNG Crooked – Life


Crooked drops Life as the follow up to last weeks Cigar Boy freestyle. He should just dub these Hip Hop Weekly again and takeover. Royce & Crook have a nice freestyle competition going on now.

Raekwon ft. G-Eazy – Purple Brick Road

24hrs – VSVSVS


I’m expecting big things from 24hrs in 2017. This Nard & B produced single is smooth as usual. Make sure to check out CultureLeak’s 24hrs Reinvented compilation mixtape.

Bones – TakingOutTheTrash


Bones isn’t for everyone, but his fanbase is really solid. Most of them will love this new single, which is better than most of his recent material in my opinion. Don’t sleep on our Bones mixtape!

Future – Future


Future drops his new self-titled album with little promotion. FUTURE clocks in just over an hour, without features. It marks Future’s fifth album release, following the well-received Evol.

NAV ft. The Weeknd – Some Way


I’m not sold on NAV yet, but this new single with The Weeknd is more than solid. NAV announced that his album will drop later this month.

Wale – Shape Of You (Remix)


Nothing can top Sickick’s remix of the Ed Sheeran hit-single for me, but Wale does a nice rendition. Wale is on a great streak of freestyles and singles. Check some of them out here.

$UICIDEBOY$ ft. Germ – Cash Me Ousside (How Bow Dah)


$UICIDEBOY$ with yet another hard-hitting banger. I’m not too familiar with Germ, but he kills his verse on this single. How Bow Dah?

Vado – Same Gang


Vado has pretty much been replaced by Dave East. He’s looking to make his mark again, but Same Gang doesn’t do it for me. His SiNAtRA 2 tape should be coming soon.

SiR ft. Anderson Paak & King Mez – New LA


TDE’s latest/mystery signee SiR released the Her Too project. Here’s one of my favorite cuts off the EP. King Mez never had a bad verse.

Tony Moxberg ft. Styles P – Welcome To The Jungle

Jidenna – Bambi


Jidenna is one of the more interesting artists out, but thus far his persona and his content didn’t seem to match. Bambi is the type of record I’ve been expecting Jidenna to make for a while now.

Russ ft. Rexx Life Raj – Take It All In


You can’t deny Russ’ work ethic. Take It All In is the latest in a long row of bangers and it happens to be one of my favorites.
