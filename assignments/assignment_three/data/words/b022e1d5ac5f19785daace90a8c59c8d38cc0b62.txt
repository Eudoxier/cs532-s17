Hacking Health (HH) is a global movement to transform healthcare through creative collaboration between healthcare professionals and technology creators. Some of the ways that HH is transforming healthcare: Cafés: where people and ideas mingle. This is where community begins and expands. Hackathons: intense, scrappy, and informal in just the right doses. Teams quickly form, collaborate and test ideas with functional prototypes - all in one weekend. We look forward to meeting you!
