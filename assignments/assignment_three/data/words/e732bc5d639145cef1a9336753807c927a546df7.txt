 CCP Candidate feedback 
        "The  service that was provided by APMG was both professional and compassionate to the needs of modern Information Security strategic leaders. Their advice was clear and concise; the support provided by the team was very timely and I always felt that I simply had to ask for help and it would be sorted out – from feedback to clarification on preparation no request was too big or too small. I had a very favourable experience with APMG and would strongly recommend them to anyone seeking CCP accreditation” by Chris Crowther, Corsham Institute
