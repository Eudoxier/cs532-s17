EMAIL:oglemaureen@gmail.com "Your writing is an embarrassment. Please give up yourwriting career and get a socially useful job. The world wouldbe a better place." -- email from a reader  "Ogle is for the most part a pleasant, incisive companion. Occasionally, though, she manages to lose her cool — and, along with it, the agnostic veneer of her training . . . . She strafes Ralph Nader and his “Naderites,” not to mention journalists, “yuppies,” urbanites, the U.S.D.A. and the F.D.A. Eventually Ogle, her exasperation at a boiling point, does something unexpected: She sides with the hippies." -- Nick Reding, New York Times Book Review The latest from The Observation Post

Not all podcasts are equal, by the way. When I first dived into that media arena, I encountered some serious dogs. Mangy mutts. I lasted less than ten minutes before I clicked "off."

Here's something I've pondered: What happens if the nation's troops are asked to act against Americans? Remember, DT is the "commander-in-chief." He's the civilian who, in theory, stands between the military and the citizenry.
