					The new home for engineering & technology jobs


Last year our parent company Matchtech Group PLC acquired Networkers International PLC and since then we’ve been researching our key markets and re-defining our service offering to ensure we can offer you more opportunities than ever.
The Connectus technology recruitment consultancy has now been incorporated into Networkers to form a global, leading technology recruitment company. The engineering technology division of Connectus and the engineering division of Networkers has been incorporated in to global engineering recruiter Matchtech as of the same date.
Under the new structure we are capturing the ever increasing skill convergence between engineering and IT, so some jobs cross over. Therefore you may wish to review both websites as suitable opportunities could exist on both.
