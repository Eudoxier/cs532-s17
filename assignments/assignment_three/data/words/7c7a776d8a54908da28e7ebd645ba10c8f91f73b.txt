~Pizza Cake HACK!

Well…Since the very first time I saw that Pizza Cake (you know the one).. my first thought was..WOW, and my second thought (which pretty much didn’t even give my first thought a chance to finish..rude) was ‘Bleh..that’s TOO SO much work!’   Followed by a third and forth set of thoughts = 3. ‘Those dough layers look uh..very doughy!’ AND > 4.  ‘That’s a LOT of work!’  (I know..#4 is a repeat thought, but it is a LOT of work..haha)

Anyway~  It only took me a matter of seconds to figure out how to achieve that Pizza Cake WOW factor with almost zero effort (cuz that’s just how I roll around here)  🙂

Following one of my many food mottos “A recipe should never take you longer to read than it does to cook” I quickly opened a few boxes of frozen Pizza and got my ‘Cake’ on in the cheesiest and EASIEST way ever!

You! Are! Welcome!  🙂

Now you can impress or horrify your family and friends without even breaking a sweat, ..good times!

What you’ll need:

An 8″ spring-form pan
3-4 8″ frozen pizzas..your fave brand!  Make sure they’re DEFROSTED!
2 cups of shredded cheese, I used cheddar, cuz that’s what I had on hand..but Mozzarella will work awesome!
10-12 Pepperoni

Directions:
This is stupid simple, so just go with it..lol
Ok~  Layer one of the pizzas in the pan and top it with some shredded cheese a.k.a glue!

Now top it with another pizza and more cheese…
Again & again as high up as you’d like your cake to be ( I went 3 high)..then top the entire thing with cheese and pepperoni!

Bake it at 350 degrees for approx. 30-45 minutes or until it’s warm, melty, and gooey all the way through.

Let it cool a bit before popping it out of the pan…

Then GO FOR IT!  Take in your Ta-Dah moment..be proud of this hack, laziness is an art!  🙂

Slice it up..

Plate it up!

Eat it up!

I cannot wait to try this but 8″ inch pizzas? Are these the single serve type? How many ounces in an 8″ pizza because most of the frozen ones seem to be larger then to fit in a spring foam pan?

totino party pizzas are the CORRECT size for an 8″ springform pan.
