Open-source Hack Night








3 days ago · 6:00 PM




Hatch




We're joining up with Code for Hampton Roads for a special hack night for open-source software. If you're never contributed to open-source, this is a great time to open your first pull-request. If you're a veteran, now is the time to get more commits under your belt or to mentor someone else.
This is open to everyone no matter your preferred language or development experience. Many contributions to open-source are simply improvements to documentation!
Agenda:
• 6:00 pm -  Introductions 
• 6:30 pm - Start Hacking!
• 8:30 pm - Wrap Up/Discussion.
Pizza will be sponsored by Langa.
**Please take a minute to read our Code of Conduct.
