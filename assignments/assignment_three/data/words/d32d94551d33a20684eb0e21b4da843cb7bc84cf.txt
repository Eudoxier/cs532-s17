SMART HOME
An AXON-enabled smart home gives you peace of mind, enabling the control and monitoring of the home and devices in it, including connectivity, lighting, media and security.
ENERGY
Real-time energy usage and response to influxes in energy usage. AXON Platform helps the grid to respond to energy fluctuations as they happen. 
TRACKING
Manage remote assets that are connected to the cell network. This allows those in supply chain management to track product deliveries. 
REMOTE SENSING
AXON Platform automates, manages and controls lighting along streets and around large, industrial buildings. This keeps facilities safe, secure and energy efficient. 
 BUILT FOR IoT EVOLUTION
Unlike vertical applications built to a narrow set of specific use cases, AXON Platform is  horizontally built and modular by design, scaling to connect a broad and ever-expanding range of device-powered, real-time data. As the IoT ecosystem evolves, AXON Platform extends—and so can your managed IoT services.
THE COMMON LANGUAGE OF IoT
With the AXON Platform, IoT language barriers are a thing of the past. Data from devices and services with disparate protocols (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, Z-Wave and more) are all translated into the same, standard IP-based language, leveraging a powerful automation engine to connect the widest variety of IoT devices from the widest variety of vendors. 

 A SECURE IoT PLATFORM
AXON Platform acts as an on-ramp for new IoT devices and services, empowering our partners to create, deploy and maintain innovative new revenue-generating applications with speed and certainty. Our IoT platform enables operators around the world to monetize their networks quickly for the connected future, reduce complexity, and simultaneously address security, flexibility and scale.
