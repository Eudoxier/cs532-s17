That Moment When You Drop Your Phone and It Lands Face DownAnd then, your heart stops beating for a few secondsYou watch TV all snuggled up under the super-soft blanket with your phone just next to you on the couch. It’s a commercial break, and you snatch at the glass of wine on the coffee table when, suddenly, you hear a noise. It sounds like something just hit the ground. You don’t look around, but in that half of second, you know it can’t be good.It can be just two things. It’s either the remote or the phone. You start praying it’s the remote. It’s not. It’s the phone, and it’s laying on the ground face down after what seemed to be like a pretty strong hit. Yo...With a Soaring iPhone, Who Needs Anything Else?Here's a case for iPhone 7s, not iPhone 8The first quarter of fiscal 2017 is the best ever for iPhone. Apple sold 78.3 million iPhones in the past few months. The revenue from the iPhone business alone topped $54.4 billion. The best model was, rather unexpectedly, the iPhone 7 Plus. But is that enough to make Apple a winner in the long run?Two very low quartersThe market will stagnate for Apple in the next couple of quarters. The first reason is obvious: no Black Friday, no Christmas or any other important holidays will help the iPhone business. Also, keep in mind that every iOS user will quit spending money on an 8-month-old device and wait...What's in Store for Apple in 2017Will Apple dedicate more time and money to the cloud? How about Siri and the Desktop computer line-up?2016 was all about the MacBook. The computer that is going to change the future of ports and connectors was born. We have also got a phone with a missing headphone jack. For some users, this is a big downer. Others are happy with their AirPods. Next year seems to be a good one for the desktop computer. Will the Mac mini survive? Is the Mac Pro still up for a refresh?Siri on macOSSiri jumped from the iPhone to the Mac in 2016. It was a long-awaited move that failed to amaze users. Sure enough, the implementation is simple and elegant, just as Apple would do it, but the functionality lacks. Siri ca...The Long Road to Adobe Flash Player 24 for LinuxAdobe finally brings Linux client in sync with the Windows version, four years after it decided to give up on itThe top companies in the tech world are getting tired of Adobe’s Flash Player, and after many years of struggling to deal with its security vulnerabilities, key players like Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Mozilla are finally pushing for the transition to HTML5 in a more aggressive way.Flash Player will be disabled by default in browsers developed by these companies, as HTML5 will be preferred on websites that support it, and users will be given full control over Flash content on websites where it’s absolutely mandatory.And while the trend here is to step away from Flash, Adobe is trying exa...The Rise and Fall of Chinese Giant LeEcoThe higher they rise, the harder they fallLeEco is one of world's largest tech companies, or we should say "was" considering the circumstances. LeEco's businesses cover a wide range of high-tech sectors including smartphones, TVs, media content, electric bicycles and cars, as well as movies.Founded 12 years ago by Jia Yueting, LeEco is a holding company that owns many businesses all over the world. However, the Chinese giant started its climb in the Mainland, as the first streaming company in China to go public.LeEco is also known as China's Netflix since it's the largest company in the country that provides media co...Look at the MacBook Pro as The Original iPhoneNot happy about a Mac laptop that only has four ports? It is time to embrace the new standard in desktop computingBack in 2007, Steve Jobs re-surfaced an old Wayne Gretzky quote saying that "I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been. And we've always tried to do that at Apple. Since the very very beginning. And we always will."Maybe he referred to the iPhone, but you can apply that to most of the products they have released in the past decade and a half. I believe the new MacBook Pro makes no exception and it is just the beginning of a new line of products in Apple's history. The shape of the new MacBook ProApple's motto for the MacBook is "Light. Years ahead....Apple and the New Kid in Town. How Google Pixel Will Change the iPhoneDid the iPhone find its match? Will the Google Pixel challenge the iPhone to become something much better?Slow update cycles, malware, OS not optimized to the hardware and bloatware. These are the main complaints when it comes to Android smartphones. You can blame Google, the carriers or the hardware manufacturers, but you can never find a solution for all of the problems. Until now. Google Pixel is the iPhone equivalent of the Android ecosystem: one phone to rule them all, made by Google and running the latest and greatest Android version. There are quite a few ways the Google Pixel will push Apple and the iPhone forward, and we are here to discuss all of them. Hardware copycatsHardware-wise th...
