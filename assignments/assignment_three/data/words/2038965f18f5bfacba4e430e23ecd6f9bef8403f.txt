Phishing Protection across the Entire Organization




With more than 90% of breaches attributed to successful phishing campaigns, it’s easy for organizations to point to the everyday employee as the root cause – as the problem to be solved. We disagree.  PhishMe believes employees –  humans – should be empowered as part of the solution to help strengthen defenses and gather real-time attack intelligence to stop attacks in progress.

RecognizePhishing attacks like ransomware and business email compromise (BEC) target people – so when a phish gets through your technology, your employees need to be able to recognize the attempt. Learn More 



ResearchNot all intelligence sources are the same. PhishMe focuses on phishing-specific threats and provides human-vetted analysis of phishing and ransomeware campaigns and the malware they contain. Easily integrated across multiple security solutions – you can confirm and respond to real threats in less time. Learn More 

 
 




ReportIt’s not enough to delete a bad email. Employees are your last line of defense and your best source of knowledge. Engaging them to report attacks in progress can significantly decrease time to respond to developing threats and attacks in progress. Learn More 



RespondSecurity Operations and Incident Response teams have the daunting and thankless job of sorting through alarms and reports to determine what’s real and what isn’t. PhishMe helps to significantly speed the collection, analysis and response to real phishing threats.Learn More
