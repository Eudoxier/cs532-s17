After some years developing web application projects with TYPO3.CMS I‚Äòd like to share and discuss my thoughts about project deployment, building and dependency management with the current LTS version 6.2+ with a broader audience.

                    Testing HTML rendering for a reStructuredText TYPO3 extension documentation

                                sphinx
                            

                                restructuredtext
                            

                                rest
                            

                                documentation
                            








This is my approach to test a reStructuredText documentation for a TYPO3 extension.
I read through the various Wiki pages and compiled this little guide. I think it is a more lightweight approach instead of installing the TYPO3 extensions restdoc/sphinx into a TYPO3 instance.

                    How to render reStructuredText documents with latest docutils on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
                
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS comes with Python docutils version 0.8.1.
This version lacks support for ::code directives and some more features which prevents you from testing your reStructuredText document before uploading it to Github.
This little guide will help you to solve this problem by showing you the necessary steps to preview your document with the latest docutils version available in a sandboxed Python environment.

                    How to cleanup outdated TYPO3 development projects
                
During development of different TYPO3 projects I've forgotten to clean up the development directory regularly. So, after a while I even forgot which TYPO3 version was used by each project. To see the target of the source symlink the find command is very useful. The following gist snippet is a reminder to myself and maybe it's even useful for you!

                    Multi language/domain setup with RealURL - revised
                
The development of RealURL has made great progress and after the latest comment on an older article I decided to review the setup of a multilingual site with TYPO3.
The setup must meet two major objectives: language switching by domain, a proper language switching menu with properly encoded page paths.
Note, that this setup follows a very basic approach which don't include any configuration for extensions or special requirements.
