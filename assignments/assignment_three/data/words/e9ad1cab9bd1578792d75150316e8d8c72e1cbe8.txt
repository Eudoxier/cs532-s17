TVUHBC Hydro - Motivated By Greed, Not Need with Norm Farrell


						How times change. Despite the official storyline remaining constant, no matter the evidence, the statistics or the facts to the contrary. Especially in the British Columbia of Christy Clark and the BC Liberals.
					

						For over a decade, the story of how BC is going to need massive new amounts of electricity supply and generation have been trumpeted by government and the BC Hydro utility itself. The first campaign was all about conservation and efficiency. Well, it worked and still does as technology rapidly changes and consumers make smarter choices. Problem is, for BC Hydro, it is working too well. Those programs have been defunded and forgotten despite the market as a whole still utilizing them.
					

						Billions of dollars continue to flow out from BC Hydro and Victoria every year for...who exactly? Accounting chicanery and slick public relations can no longer obscure the mess that grows by the day and has no sign of stopping. What is the motivation for this? Well, it's not need. It's flat-out greed.
					

						Norm Farrell (@Norm_Farrell), journalistic investigator extraordinaire and publisher of In-Sights (In-Sights) returns to explain this racket in a manner that everyone can plainly understand, except apparently those perpetrating it.
					

						The BC Series is back and painting a clear picture. Christy and the BCLibs need to be held accountable.

About The View Up Here

A little about your host Canadianglen.









The View Up Here is an idea that Glen Type Guy thinks Canada is ready for. He understands how difficult it is for people outside of the usual suspect media "commentary" bubble to even get their pulse taken. Never mind asking their opinion or giving them some truly important information.
The last decade has seen news gathering and objective investigative reporting virtually disappear for the most part. News is now Infotainment. News must make a profit. And nowhere near enough people like sour candy compared to those who like the super sweet fluffy candy.
And the aloof, indifferent, unconcerned governance we get has taken full advantage. Parties are brands. False platforms are products. Votes are purchases. There is definitely no shortage of sales force members either. On all sides, for all manner of products.
It seems when Glen looks into something that concerns him, he finds an awful lot of things never mentioned by the sales force. These things are almost always not "positive selling points". So they go without mention, if possible.
Glen Type Guy draws inspiration from those bucking this trend. In print. On the airwaves. On your screens. Writing books. Creating art. Trying to get the truth out. They are out there. Glen supports and salutes them.
Glen Type Guy wants to help. He invites everyone to join him, which will make "us". We are the people. We are Canada.
