My Dad's Deaths

Aussie Rules Footy (Playing With Men)
Jon Bennett (5 x Just For Laughs Award nominee and Moth Story Slam Winner) was a great junior footballer in Southern Australia. He was set to ‘MAKE IT’ until he started playing with men… real men. His football career came crashing down when a community tragedy made him re-evaluate his life. It’s about community, friendships, life and death and football. This is a ‘work in progress show’ from a ‘work in progress human’.**Just for Laughs Best Comedy Award nomination** (Montreal Fringe, 2016)"Charming and funny" - Orlando Sentinel"The gifted story teller engaged the crowd so skilfully, within moments of the show starting you had the impression that you had known Jon since childhood. I couldn’t shake the disarming feeling of intimacy for the entire duration of the show." - CJLO Montreal"No one can observe life quite like Bennett. His delivery is infectious. Hysterical and heartfelt. A perfect example why Bennett is so excellent as a performer. His authenticity is disarming and invites self-reflection. He doesn’t hide behind his humour or have a schtick. Bennett is so honest about himself, so uncensored and willing to share himself as he is. He talks about events and things that other people would rather forget — and not just the ones that are embarrassingly funny, but also the ones that show a raw, sensitive heart. Just hearing Bennett has the sensation of making one a better person, because he invites the same kind of recognition as he accepts in himself. We are all perfectly imperfect beings." - Montreal Rampage










How I Learned To Hug
This is NOT a love story but a story of love… in the Montreal airport…**Best Comedy Award Nominee (Perth Fringe World, 2015)**Just for Laughs Award nomination for Best Comedy (Montreal Fringe, 2014)“The rumours are true – Bennett possesses a masterful narrative skill, taking us on a journey full of heartbreak, joy and a whole lot of dick jokes. He brings depth to the dumb stuff and levity to the heavy stuff, and is totally unafraid of revealing the most brutally personal details of his life story. ★★★★“ - SBS Television (Melbourne)“Über-Funny and vulnerable — hold on to your panties, Ladies.“ – Montreal Rampage“An expert story teller” - Capital Critics Circle (Montreal)“Bennett sure knows how to weave a yarn.” – Herald Sun (Melbourne)
