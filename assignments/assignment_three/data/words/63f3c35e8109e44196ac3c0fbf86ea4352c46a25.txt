Do something. Measure it. 
Working Together to Eradicate Systemic Cyber Risk



Less Talk. More Action.

We are in a perpetual cat-and-mouse game between cyber attackers and the concerned cyber professionals that stand in their way. The reality of cyber risk is undeniable, but that does not mean we can not make measurable progress to reduce it.
By addressing systemic cyber issues methodically, risk by risk, and taking action against threat actors, we can form a united front to eradicate these risks.

Cyber Risks 
As connectivity increases, so does network vulnerability. Personal and business data is perpetually at risk. Most attacks take months to identify, and the damage can take years to repair. We’re taking incremental steps to help businesses and individuals improve their security.
Our Mission
The Global Cyber Alliance (GCA) is an international, cross-sector effort dedicated to confronting cyber risk and improving our connected world. We are a catalyst to bring communities of interest and affiliations together in an environment that sparks innovation with concrete, measurable achievements.
Current Initiatives
We are addressing critical cyber risk issues with surgical precision. The initiatives we are currently pursuing center around the most common cyber threats individuals and businesses face – threats revolving around identity, authentication, and malware attacks.



Recent Initiative

UNITING A GLOBAL COMMUNITY

Systemic cyber risks transcend borders and nation states. These truly are global challenges that require international cooperation to resolve. We are building a results-oriented collective of partners to help bridge the gaps between the public and private sectors, governments and concerned citizens alike. At GCA we bring people together to spark innovation and combat cyber risks, regardless of sector, industry or geographic location.
