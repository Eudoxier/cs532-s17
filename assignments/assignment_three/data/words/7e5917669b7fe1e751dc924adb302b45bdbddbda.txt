DotEmu are no strangers to porting monumental games to mobile but Titan Quest was their biggest game yet. It might not be the perfect port that you'd expect, as some technical issues have been plaguing the game since launch, but it's more than competent enough and the interface as been well ported to touchscreen devices.  Subscribe to AppSpy on The game's as addicting as ever though and still is a 20+ hours experience even without the add-on. For the first time, the game has been dropped to a mere $/€/£4.99 on both iOS and Android and you should pick it up if you're in the market for a classic yet satisfying hack and slash.
