 Benefits to Plant Life. Livestock grazing controls the growth of the non-native grasses and herbs so that other desirable plants (wildflowers and native grasses) can regenerate and coexist with them. Many plants, including several endangered species, require grazing to maintain viable populations. 
 Since livestock graze the grassland they help restore balance through their urine and manure deposition. In return the grassland grows green thus repaying the livestock by producing fresh plants for them to eat. This can help you save a lot of money in buying nutritious livestock feed.
 Some livestock such as goats and sheep are known to be social. Once you establish a solid relationship with them they will enjoy spending time with you. This means you can freely go with them for hikes with no worry on what they will eat because they will find some greens along the way.

"You Helped Me Save A Lot"
Hello Sir,
I would like to let you know that your ebook has helped me save a lot in buying books on raising various types of livestock.
When I started raising cattle I went to a local farming seminar which cost me over $300 to attend and at the end of the seminar I had to buy a cattle handbook which cost $76.
Later last month I decided to start raising goats as well but just wasn't prepared to spend money again on seminars, I knew that there must be cheaper training.
When searching online for a guide to raising goats I came across your ebook. And since it teaches how to raise various livestock including goats at a fraction of the cost of the seminar I attended in only raising cattle, I didn't think twice but to get a copy.
I must say that your ebook does over deliver, it has all in the information they taught us in that raising cattle seminar. Amazing!
I'm so excited now because I got all the guidelines and reference to raise goats, chickens, sheep and rabbits just from your ebook. I don't have to spend money in attending seminars or buying individual books.
Thank You!
Collin de Sousa

"A Good Livestock Foundation"
All I can say to a person who is still thinking of getting this livestock ebook that I highly recommend you do.
I'm an advanced livestock farmer with years of experience and I learned to be a successful farmer the hard way. I had lots of herds dying at a young age and through diseases that I never knew anything about. And that has cost me a lot. There's a time I sort of regretted being a farmer because I felt it was such a hustle and the return in investment was minimal. 
I came across your ebook when looking for treatment for one my cattle that persistently failed to breed and bear young. It was now 3 years and I knew that I had to find a solution.
Reading that your ebook gives guidelines on raising cattle as well I just had to get a copy. After reading a few chapters, how I wished I had gotten it earlier. All the problems I faced in my novice years are covered. I even found the solution of how to treat my cattle not bearing young in your ebook. Its suitable for a beginner and advanced farmer.
I've always had second thoughts in raising ducks and sheep because of the bad experience I got from raising cattle. But now its not the same, I'm starting with ducks, then sheep later next year using your ebook as reference.
Thanks!
