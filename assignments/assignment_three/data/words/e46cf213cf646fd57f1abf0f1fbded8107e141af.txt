        Manatee School District suffers an e-mail cyber attack

Bradenton, Fla. -- More than 77-hundred district employees W-2 forms could have been compromised."This is a highly organized e-mail phishing scam and has been perpetrated at other school districts, hospitals and restaurants around the country.", saidManatee School District Deputy Superintendent of Business Services Ron CirannaHe also said this e-mail went straight to the district's payroll division, claiming to be from Superintendent Dr. Diana Greene--with one specific request."Forward all school employees 2016 w-2 forms to me attached and sent to a PDF."Fortunately the district didn't respond to the request.A request Ciranna says that would have never been requested by the superintendent."The superintendent is very hands on...she speaks to all employees in the entire district. she's everywhere....she's more proactive."Once the district was aware of the scam, the IRS and FBI were contacted in an effort to stop data from these W-2's that may have been compromised."They're going to do their own investigation. they're also going to put all of our information into our database to ensure that if any other individuals or organizations try to file a tax return with any of our names or social security numbers that those would be acted upon immediately."According to the Sylint Group's cyber-security expert Serge Jorgensen--with just a couple clicks---the attacker has all the information they need to cripple the company."They're going to try to use that information to file a fraudulent return and set up the return so that you get a tax refund and they will try to redirect that refund instead of going to your bank account, they'll direct it to their bank account."
