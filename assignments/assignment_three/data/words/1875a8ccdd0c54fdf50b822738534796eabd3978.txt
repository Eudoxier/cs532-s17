 DAY ONE is a field recording about a world so eccentric that the container it comes in is infinite. From radio rockabilly static over the high desert morning, to the dutiful bear who wrote his memoir on a Mexican typewriter, DAY ONE is a chronicle of the day, the one and only day, day one.So. How are things with you? Good? All best,WIREMESA
