Catch The Baby



 

Catch the Baby explores the dramatic evolution of medical training and technology over the past fifty years.  Charismatic obstetrician and cowboy Dr. Bert Johnson takes the audience on a tour of kitchen table deliveries in the 1950s Chicago slums to Silicon Valley’s high tech medical centers today.
And while no one suggests that we go back to the way things were in the 1950s, there are things to be learned from the way medicine used to be practiced…

Can we put a better sense of humanity back into childbirth today, balancing care that sacrifices neither cutting edge technology nor the gentle art of creating
a caring doctor-patient relationship??
