Acquire Data.





LookingGlass begins by casting a wide net in our acquisition of raw data. Your internal security teams are challenged with gaining a clear and complete picture of the threat landscape. That’s why LookingGlass looks beyond structured data sets and known threats to uncover the key information needed to make informed, timely decisions.
















Manage Intelligence.





Once data has been acquired and enriched, LookingGlass provides innovative Threat Intelligence Platforms (TIP) to manage high volumes of intelligence. Our platforms identify threats outside of an organization’s environment and enable analysts to see how assets within their own environment are interacting with external threats.
















Defend Assets.





LookingGlass defense solutions operationalize threat intelligence and provide automation to block all threats, including the most critical threats endangering your organization. They’re fully integrated with actionable threat intelligence originating from high-quality data feeds, allowing for automated threat mitigation at machine speeds.
















End-to-End Threat Intelligence-Driven Security





From data acquisition and intelligence management to human analysis and threat defense, LookingGlass provides end-to-end security solutions. Using data that has been automated and enriched, LookingGlass operationalizes threat intelligence at multiple points along the kill chain, prioritizing threats and preventing attacks from damaging your company, your brand, and your employees.
