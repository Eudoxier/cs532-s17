News 









































 
A cryptocurrency trader based in China's Hunan province is bringing a lawsuit against cryptocurrency exchange OKCoin.
According to court documents, the trader deposited the cryptocurrency litecoin in an account at the exchange, only to wake up the next day to find the funds traded without his notice.
The filing asserts that the trader believes he was the subject of a successful hack, and that representatives of OKCoin should bear responsibility. He further claimed that the IP address used to execute the trade was based in Hong Kong.
In total, the trader estimates his total loss at $2,900.
OKCoin did not provide comment when requested by CoinDesk.
