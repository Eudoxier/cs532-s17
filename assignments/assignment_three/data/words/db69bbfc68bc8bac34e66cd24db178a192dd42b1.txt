Meet Me



I've worked through all sorts of jobs and titles in the IT industry until I finally realised that I'm way too interested in the technical part of the online process, and calling myself a “nerd” sounded more like a compliment than an insult.
I started my professional career as a IT Tester at a Software company 6 years ago, which was followed by a role as a Web Project Manager. Although talking big marketing words and clichés is not my favourite bit, it was still pretty cool because this experience helped me to learn how to deal with clients and stakeholders, and gain knowledge of how important it is to understand your client’s needs in order to achieve the final “wow” effect. However, it soon became apparent that I really enjoyed spending time with the designers and developers and understanding how they do their magic. I started trying it myself and I naturally gravitated to web design and development.
