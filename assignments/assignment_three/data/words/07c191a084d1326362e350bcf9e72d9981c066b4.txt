Class of 2020 Guide To ‘Swinging

Posted on August 28, 2016  by  weswingsguy 


Eggs Benedict with fresh Asparagus one of many Weekend Brunch specials
You’ve heard about it.  They have cookie dough.  Maybe you even ate there during WesFest.  But now you’re here, standing in line, with a crowd around you, and you hear one of the cashiers yell, “Can I help who’s next?”  
WesWings can be a little daunting the first few times.  Some will panic and just order a burger and fries or a chicken sandwich.  Our menu is pretty extensive and the choices are vast.

What kind of bread?
Regular or spicy fries?
What kind of sauce?
Here or to go?

To list just a few of the questions you’ll be asked.
So here are a few ideas to help you get the most out of our little dining establishment.

Water is free, cups are not.  We charge 25 cents for a water cup so if you don’t want to buy a drink, bring your own mug.  We do this to reduce waste, not make money.
To Go containers are free.  Our portions are big and delicious so why not bring it home.

What to order?

Red & Black Cafe Not Moving

Posted on April 29, 2016  by  weswingsguy 


UPDATE 12/1/16
Yesterday President Roth announced the location for the new bookstore on Main St.  We want to let everyone know, the Red & Black Cafe is not moving and will remain where it is.  We are in the early planning stages to reconfigure our space at 45 Broad St. and have quite a few exciting ideas, both in design and menu.  We hope to make those announcements  next semester as they become more clear.
————————————————————
April 29, 2016
On Friday at the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce breakfast meeting, President Roth announced plans to move Broad Street Books to Main St.  We want to assure all of our customers and staff that The Red & Black Cafe will not be moving as part of that relocation.  Earlier this week, we met with our official contacts at Wesleyan.  The Red & Black Cafe has and will continue to be an integral part of campus dining.  The cafe will remain at 45 Broad St.  The university has not yet decided what will fill the space vacated by the bookstore.  It may be used for academic or other student uses.  The plan would be to divide the space to accommodate the new tenants.
We have also had preliminary discussions with Wesleyan regarding the new bookstore on Main St and may be involved in developing a cafe within the new store.
We have a long history owning and operating dining establishments at Wesleyan and downtown Middletown.  WesWings is celebrating twenty-five years in business.  The Red & Black Cafe is completing its thirteenth year.  Twenty years ago, we opened and ran the successful Eleanor Rigby’s Gourmet Delicatessen & Cafe on Main St.  We are looking forward to continuing our great partnership with Wesleyan and excited at the possible new opportunities as well.
