The PrivacyMaxx Protection Plan for TripleClicks

ID theft is about MUCH more than a stolen credit card. Stolen identities are used to fraudulently obtain medical services, commit crimes, acquire fraudulent documentation, take over your current bank or investment accounts, and obtain credit for which repayment will never be made, destroying your credit rating along the way.

PrivacyMaxx's proprietary Identity Early Warning System monitors billions of public data sources to protect against ID theft and its potentially life-altering effects for victims.

In the event of ID theft, you'll get direct access to a PrivacyMaxx professional recovery advocate, who will manage the entire recovery process for you and your family. In addition to handling the follow-up, paperwork, and phone calls for you to recover your name and credit history, your advocate will document, dispute and reverse all fraudulent transactions for all known types of identity theft. As an added layer of protection, you'll also get 12 months of Internet Monitoring follow-up once you are back to pre-theft status.
