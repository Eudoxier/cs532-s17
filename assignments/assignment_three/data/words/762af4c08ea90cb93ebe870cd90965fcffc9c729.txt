The Makers House
The Makers house is our most recent self-build development. It is a contemporary London villa. The house's name stems from the myriad processes that we combined to create the building. We fetishise the details in our buildings, and enjoy working with a rich spectrum of hand-assembled materials. Texture, temperature and aroma are fundamental to the design. For example, the various spaces on the upper floors are unified by a richly coloured Rhodesian mahogany parquet floor which was reclaimed from Hove Fire Station in the 1970s, the timber is extremely durable and tactile.The house stands between two pairs of tall mid-Victorian villas. These once stood opposite Terrace Lodge, a substantial country house on the Western edge of Well Street Common. Together with Cassland Crescent, these houses are at the Northern end of the Victoria Park village.Arranged over four storeys, the house contains a variety of bright, tall spaces. At the top floor, two private studio bedrooms top lit from north light flank a bright bathroom with separate shower and bath. At first floor level an ensuite guest room faces Terrace Road; to the rear is an expansive master bedroom suite with its own study and dedicated dressing room. The bedroom itself is linked to a open-plan bathroom, separated by a massive textured wall that slides to one side to separate the spaces. The upper floors feature large, naturally lit landings designed for displaying art or special furniture pieces.At ground floor and basement, a multi-level ’broken plan’ arrangement creates a variety of living spaces within a single volume. Each zone provides different atmospheres to curate moments of solitude or gathering. At the entrance level, the West-facing sitting room provides a formal space at a raised level which looks down onto the bespoke hand built kitchen and dining area. The whole rear facade at ground level is constructed from three large pivoting glazed doors which (two which are full height)  open out to the courtyard garden. Stairs lead down from the kitchen to the basement where there is a dedicated utility room, larder and snug / TV area.  Natural light is the most important material. We took a scientific approach to maximising natural light in the living spaces. Careful CAD modelling of the site and its surroundings allowed us to adjust the building’s form and windows to capture sunlight at key parts of the day - the house is lit from the flank and the roof - a rarity in London streets.The Makers House signifies its position in Hackney at the heart of London’s creative community, which is reviving the borough’s status as a place of craft and industry. The house is on the North side of Victoria Park Village, close to the newly completed fashion quarter and Well Street. The house is adjacent to the wide green spaces of Well Street common and a short walk to the handsome Victoria Park.
