Implausible? Not any more.

Content is king in a digitally enabled business – but it’s under relentless threat from cyber attack
Threat detection is inevitably evaded, whilst threat isolation restricts your business agility – the only safe approach for your business is to remove the threat entirely.
 
 
 
 



Why is it needed?
 
 
 




Threat Detection
 
Trying to identify bad data or bad behaviour
 
Failure inevitable
Cannot detect the unknown
Easily evaded
Zero day attacks missed
 
 



Threat Isolation
 
Containing the damage caused by the threat
 
Isolates the business
Loss of agility
Prone to failure
 
 



Threat Removal
 
Only deliver inherently safe
data
 
Doesn’t distinguish good from bad
Allows safe access to unsafe data
 
 
 


Dispensing with the failed paradigm of detecting threats or isolating the business, we treat all data with the potential to do harm equally to ensure total Content Threat Removal.

Senior Executive of a multi-national

Compliance
When handling sensitive information, you don’t just have to look after it but demonstrate that you are doing so. That’s what our platform gives you.
 
 

Accountability
Holding users to account means having visibility of what they are doing in your business. Most security mechanisms operate at the network level and so don’t give you the right visibility – not us – we work at the business level.
 
 
 


Brand Protection
Cyber defences that are not going to fail, says something about the value you place on your business platform, giving customers, partners, and investors confidence.
 
 

Audit
By operating at the business level, our platform directly controls the business information leaving your system, meaning it is perfectly placed to record exactly what you need and no more.
