Continuous vulnerability management by edgescan

                                    We perform continuous vulnerability assessments of all assets, as much or as little as you require.  edgescan  assessments cover both technical to logical testing and cover all OWASP vulnerabilities, WASC threat classification and CWE known vulnerabilities. edgescan also aligns and surpasses PCI compliance requirements.

                                    False Positive Free: Manual verification by our expert security analysts ensures that all application and network vulnerabilities found are verified as real and ranked by security risk. This procedure allows for a false positive free vulnerability intelligence for all assets.
