We're revolutionizing industrial control And setting industry free
While control systems seem to be crawling into the future, the technologies from which they are built are not.  Moore's law, material science, software and standards race ahead at an accelerating pace with little concern for those left behind...until now. Bedrock Automation has reinvented all aspects of industrial control, resulting in an automation revolution that sets you free.
Introducing Bedrock™














Welcome to the Industrial Control Revolution
With a blank sheet of paper and few technological constraints,Bedrock Automation has re-imagined every aspect of automation to make it trulySimple, Scalable and Secure.

SIMPLE
One controller. One power supply. One I/O module.
			Extreme I/O innovation leads to  a dramatic reduction in part numbers and life cycle costs.


SCALABLE
From tens to tens of thousands of I/O
			A 4GB electromagnetic backplane is the foundation for software-defined I/O and universal control and power ensuring an automation solution of virtually any size without compromise.


SECURE
Built in versus bolted on
			Deep-trust cyber defense  embedded into processor,  memory, communications, inter-connections, backplane  and packaging technologies.


About Us






Bedrock™ Changing the user experience







Backplane
Finally!  I/O, power and communications without a single backplane I/O pin. A true breakthrough, the Bedrock Backplane Module Interconnect, BMI, sets new standards for performance, reliability and cyber security.








I/O
Bedrock's Secure I/O Modules, SIO, use layers of advanced technology to deliver a software-defined I/O platform for Universal Analog, Serial, Discrete, Ethernet and Fieldbus I/O.








Power
Bedrock's Secure Power Module, SPM, is both functionally and physically coupled to the BMI using layers of advanced technology to deliver single and dual redundant, cyber secure power for the control system.








Controller
Bedrock's Secure Control and Communication Module, SCC, is a universal controller for virtually every conceivable ICS application independent of size or control task: Discrete, Batch, Continuous, or Multivariable control from one device supporting as little as ten, or as many as tens of thousands of I/O.



Our Products







Bedrock™ Outperforms every industrial control system



Security
Bedrock enables transparent instant cyber security that is working for you 24/7. Traditional industrial control systems are vulnerable to multiple forms of cyber attack, IP and counterfeiting theft. Black Fabric™ Cybershield is Bedrock's embedded deep trust cyber defense using patented processor, memory, communications, interconnections, backplane and packaging technologies to integrate cyber security into every ICS module.



Reliability
This unique system provides unparalleled reliability. Bedrock starts with redundant controllers based on a SiL certified RTOS, redundant digital power supplies and single, dual, triple I/O. All system modules interconnect on a patented electromagnetic backplane, a never-before-seen technology that eliminates I/O pins providing a new level of reliability, availability and performance. All backed by our 5 year warranty!




Performance
Bedrock's solution applies layers of technologies to deliver unprecedented simplicity, scalability and security.  As one example, software configured I/O  delivers on the promise of simplified engineering, commissioning and spares management. There is no turning back to the decades of rigid and costly change management and module spares.



Cost
Bedrock significantly reduces life cycle costs including system engineering, installation, commissioning, maintenance and the emergent cost of cyber security. As the designer and manufacturer of virtually all of our own active silicon components, Bedrock can offer users lifetime non-obsolescence of the system and in a single stroke eliminate the most expensive aspect of life cycle cost.


The Bedrock™ Advantage





Bedrock™ Integrated Development Environment – Empowering Innovation
Imagine... Continuous Function Charts (CFC), Ladder Logic Diagrams (LLD), Structured Text (ST) and other interoperable control languages all in one place. This modern software platform allows control functionality to be subdivided into logical elements, empowering the automation user.



Simple
A single Integrated Development Environment,


Scalable
for all your automation applications,


Secure
built on Bedrock’s deep root of trust.

Bedrock™ Embedding ics cyber security where it's never existed before

The only truly secure way to protect Industrial Control Systems is to embed security in the foundation, namely in the controller itself which requires a complete rethinking of how to architect and build Industrial Control Systems. Based on my review, Bedrock has rethought the architecture from a clean sheet of paper and embedded the security.
