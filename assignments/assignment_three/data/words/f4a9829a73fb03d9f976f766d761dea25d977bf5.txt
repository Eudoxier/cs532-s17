What it does for you









Protects you from advanced threats


Detects and removes malware in real-time with advanced anti-malware, anti-spyware, and anti-rootkit technology. Scans for the newest and most dangerous threats automatically, so you’re protected without having to even think about it.









Protects your files from being locked and held for ransom


Stops unknown and known ransomware with proprietary next-gen technology that works proactively to shield your files. This is a powerful, complete defense that blocks ransomware, and not a simple decryption tool. So you’re protected from tomorrow’s “Ransomware Attack!” headlines today. 











Prevents your programs from being used against you


Wraps your browser and software programs in four layers of defense, stopping attacks that use vulnerabilities in those programs to infect your computer.









Protects you from fake and infected websites


Detects and prevents contact with fake websites and malicious links. You are proactively protected from downloading malware, hacking attempts, and infected advertising. Worried about wandering into a “bad” Internet neighborhood? Now you don’t have to be.











Scans faster, scans smarter


Lightning-fast Hyper Scan mode targets only the threats that are currently active. Faster analysis. Still gets results. Run a scan in the background while you boot up your favorite game. It's done by the time you're ready to play.








Don't take our word for it


"Had a nasty malware infection, I tried everything out there and was about to give up. [Then I] tried Malwarebytes as a last resort. Reboot—problem solved! Worth every penny."


      sldrennan1 CNET
      
    





"I bought the Premium...I totally recommend this. You will use it every day, and with peace of mind, no matter what other security you have on your computer."
