Cybersecurity ReimaginedFor Mid-Sized Organizations







We’ve re-engineered the traditional SIEM and IDS/IPS to detect more than  just yesterday’s threats. Our industry leading threat intel provides real-time protection against known threats, while always-on full traffic capture, log correlation,  and behavior-based analytics come together to also detect the unknown.   It gets even smarter with our 24X7 elite team of cybersecurity analysts that work as an extension of your team to hunt, investigate, identify and escalate threats in real-time.
