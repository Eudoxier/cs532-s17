social media management
platform for the enterprise            



            We help the world's largest brands do marketing, advertising, care,
sales, research, and commerce on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
and 21 other social channels globally – all on one integrated platform. 















            When you deploy this platform across the enterprise and plug
it into legacy customer-facing systems like email, CRM, and the website,
you now have a unified system of engagement...that allows your employees
to collaborate in real time across business units, markets, and departmental
silos to manage customer experience – at scale.          















            We believe 



            The ability to deliver more human and intuitive experiences, at every
touchpoint, for every customer, is the single most strategic investment
for the modern enterprise.          







            We saw that from the start, and built a new
class of enterprise software to solve it.
