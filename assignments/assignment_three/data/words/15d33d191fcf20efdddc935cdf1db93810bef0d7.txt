What our Customers are saying ?







  
"Great module to connect magento to zoho, tried Zapier but it only gets error and does not work proprely. Kloudconnector was 3 minutes to configure and everything worked. Also great support"
            
-Sidney Wagenaar, SARL Insideout,France
 



 

"We were looking for connecting our CRM with eMail Marketing system. Being non-techie, I thought it would be very difficult. I was very skeptical when their support told me that I can bring my MailChimp list subscriber to Zoho contacts in just 3 minutes. To my surprise, when I signed up for ZTM ( Zoho and MailChimp) service, I could do it in just 3 minutes. Now I am planning to use their accounting system connector as well. Their support was very helpful as well."
            
-Christina , Personal Trainer, USA
 



 

"We are using ZTX ( Zoho to Xero) connector and ZTCM ( Zoho to Campaign Monitor ) from KloudConnectors. I am saving $500 per month in manual work and now can concentrate on my real work. Their dashboards are very helpful and service is great ! "

"We are using ZTBC ( Zoho and BigCommerce) connector and ZTCC ( Zoho to Constant Contact) from KloudConnectors. This helps in keeping our online stores and CRM system in sync. MailChimp connector helps us in campaign management and tracking the results of the campaigns. This not only saves 100s of man hours every month but has also helped us increase our top line. KloudConnectors has helped me in automating my business processes at a lower cost."

-Jose, eCommerce company, USA
 



 

"We are using ZTX ( Zoho and Xero) connector from KloudConnectors. This connector ensures our sales team and accounting team is always on the same page. Our sales team now knows the exact status of account receivables of their customer. It has saved us lots of time and money on accountants time as well. The service is designed using the best practices in the industry. We would recommend this service to anyone who would like to streamline their business processes."
