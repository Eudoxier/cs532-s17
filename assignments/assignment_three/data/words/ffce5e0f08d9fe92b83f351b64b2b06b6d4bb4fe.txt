Back in the 1920s people thought radio would kill the newspaper, but it didn't. Just as TV didn't kill radio, and the Internet didn't kill TV. As it turned out, an unexpected twist in the plot took place and no media is dead in the end.

The keynote that summed up women in security for me was, without a doubt, from the eloquent and engaging Dame Stella Rimington. She is a former Director General of MI5, Britain’s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency, and whom Judi Dench’s character “M” in the James Bond films was based on. In fact, when Rimington saw the film, she recognized many details of herself, down to her three-quarter trench coat and choice of heels.

During the first couple days of the RSA Conference, I've spent most of my time having informal conversations with attendees, taking briefings from vendors, and engaging in deep-dive interviews with executives and leaders from cybersecurity firms of all sizes. The two common themes thus far? Artificial intelligence/machine learning and a focus on ransomware and phishing.

Britain’s GCHQ has been actively recruiting neurodiverse people into their foreign espionage workforce, but it doesn’t take a 007 to figure out that the cybersecurity industry needs to broaden their pipeline and get more creative about recruiting more diverse individuals.
