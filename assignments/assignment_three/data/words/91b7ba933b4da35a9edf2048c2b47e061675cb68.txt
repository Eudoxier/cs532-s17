Why Should You Scan Your Websites for Vulnerabilities?
Businesses rely on web applications because they allow employees to access critical data from anywhere at anytime, enabling them to collaborate with business partners and be more productive.
                    Business-focused web applications tend to be susceptible to vulnerabilities that can be automatically detected and easily exploited. Statistics and reports from trusted sources show a constant upwards trend in successful hack attacks.
                    Beat malicious hackers at their own game; identify and fix vulnerabilities in your web applications before they find and exploit them. Use the Netsparker automated web application security scanners to automatically identify exploitable vulnerabilities and other security flaws that can leave you and your business exposed.
