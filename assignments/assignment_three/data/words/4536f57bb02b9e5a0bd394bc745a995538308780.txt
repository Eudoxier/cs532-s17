Maastricht European Centre on Privacy and CybersecurityLiving in a global society driven by digital information has profoundly transformed the way personal data is collected, accessed, used, and transferred. Businesses, public authorities, and individuals transfer vast amounts of personal data across borders on a daily basis. Whilst a digital world brings enormous economic benefits, it also creates new vulnerabilities. Cyberspace is prone to malicious activities and the misuse of personal data. The delicate balance between privacy and security is an important issue within the scope on law enforcement in cyberspace. To tackle such challenges, the Faculty of Law at Maastricht University (UM) established the European Centre on Privacy and Cybersecurity (ECPC).
