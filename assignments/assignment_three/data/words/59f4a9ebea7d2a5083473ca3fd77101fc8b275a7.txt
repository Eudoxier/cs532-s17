There are not many products I use daily and those that I do eventually become irrelevant as
                            they are replaced by someone bigger and better. Wisestamp is different. Been using it for
                            years, been getting awesome feedback on my signature for
                            years, and been enjoying a great conversation started with Wisestamp for years. Great team,
                            fantastic product that just keeps getting better

                        reply, and the signature is ready to go!
                    




Kristi Hines

                        I’m often frustrated by the lack of cohesion of my email signature depending on what program
                        folks are using to read mail. Wiseapp solves that, making me look more professional.
