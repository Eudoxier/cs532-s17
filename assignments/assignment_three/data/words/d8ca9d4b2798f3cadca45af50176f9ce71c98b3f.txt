My Life In Formation


October 29, 2016
by Neal Gammons



I really wish this article were a tale of me giving my life of sin up and turning my life to our Lord and savior Beyoncé from whom all slayings flow. It’s not though. What you’re about to read is about Uncle Sam’s military formation and how I find it to be utter garbage. I haven’t publicly addressed my military journey until now. Well I think calling it a journey is giving it too much credit. It’s more like a joyride. Not a joyride in the BMW that your Aunt Kelly is in a 20-year lease agreement for, but a joyride in the Jeepers Creepers van with Daredevil driving. And for you non-comic book readers in the audience; Daredevil is blind, that's why you were supposed to laugh.  In the military, I never know what is going on and there is a new rule or policy every damn day. No one is allowed to question what happens either. Common sense and critical thinking in the Navy/military are forbidden. You’re supervisor at work could be making you drink bleach everyday and the moment you speak up about it some old, dusty service member (which is basically all of them) will tell you to stop complaining. They love to tell you, “Well at least you’re getting paid, right?” Uncle Sam loves tradition, but the only traditions I prefer to acknowledge are traditional wings at Wingstop. Uncle Sam is the type of character to eat a bowl of cereal with a butter knife instead of a spoon. His logic you might ask; well he’s been doing it that way all his life, so it has to be done that way no matter how ineffective it is. The majority of leadership, much like the United States, consists of straight, white men from mainly middle class or higher upbringings. So I am sure they make great decisions considering their diverse pool of knowledge they draw from. Yea, that’s the same demographic of men who built the foundation of this country by killing thousands of…never mind, we’ll discuss that some other time. All people do in the military is chew tobacco, shoot guns, and pray to Donald Trump three times a day. It isn’t a big happy family who all has your back like I was told during training. People here are good for being in everyone else’s business too. And no, you don’t get paid extra or get smiley faces put on your uniform for being nosy. I hear all sorts of“Grab em by the pussy” talk everyday along with racist, homophobic, trans phobic, and really all the other isms/phobic type of speech. You know, all the talk that someone you love may or may not like. By the way, if you’re letting someone like Donald Trump grab you by the pussy, then I am assuming you probably need your rent paid or a free meal.  Honestly, the people here are more like sheep than anything. More than willing to do or think anything just for a paycheck and benefits. Let’s actually discuss these awesome benefits that civilians and military sheep think are so awesome. Well we can start with our amazing health benefits with world-renowned medical staff. The healthcare here is a joke. I could walk into the clinic with my leg blown off and ten knots on my head and the doctor would probably tell me to drink more water and prescribe me a box of Lemonheads for the pain. Let’s move on to discuss my beautiful living arrangements that are fully equipped with a mini fridge and no stove to cook on. No stove? Fine I’ll just stuff my mini fridge with Capri Suns and Lunchables; that should give me enough strength for the day for sure. Thank heavens I have a microwave though, I can heat up my gourmet popcorn for dinner. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Anyway, I am fully aware of the type of people Uncle Sam wants or needs in his military and I am not one of them. You all can sit around and see problems, but don’t fight for change all you want to. And no, I don’t necessarily want to quit; I just want Uncle Sam to do better.   “We write because we believe the human spirit cannot be tamed and should not be trained.” Nikki Giovanni

Parents, Agents of Good or Evil?


September 27, 2015
by Neal Gammons



Now don’t get me wrong parents and parent figures deserve all the respect in the world most of the time. Whether your parents are Jay-Z and Beyoncé or Master Splinter and the Green Ooze; your parents have been shady and evil from the beginning. I know what you’re thinking. How can my parents be shady and evil after all the Christmas presents, trips to Disney Land, trips to Popeye’s, home cooked meals, and etc? I know many of you grew up on boxed mac and cheese, canned sweet potatoes, and minute rice, but just pretend that’s a home cooked meal for now. How are your parents shady and evil? Is the question you still need answered, right?I only have one answer. You didn’t ask to be here, but they brought you here anyway. They brought you into this world, made you think their way, and had the nerve to boss you around for 18 years. Sounds like some form of slavery or colonization if you ask me. Who said you wanted to be bossed around? And they have the nerve to get attitudes when you ask them for stuff. If your child randomly asks you to pick apples from a tree on Jupiter, then guess what you need to do? After all, it was you who created something because you thought it was cute. Your parents brought you here and get all sassy when you need some money. How dare you be upset when you brought me here, I had nothing to do with this.You brought me into this world with spiders, unsweetened tea, bills, sugar free snacks, and vegetables. How careless can you be? I should be able to act a damn fool everyday and you shouldn’t have any say so. And when you ask, “So what did you do with the money I gave you last week?” What the hell do you mean? I spent it and I need more. No one told you to not be a millionaire before you brought me here. You wouldn’t have to give up money if you would’ve just put the Hennessey down, turned the Marvin Gaye off, and kept your body to yourself now would you?Parents just couldn’t resist bringing people into this miserable world. They pick your name, gender, and your first house. How do you know that child wanted the name Sir Rupert Douglass Worthington IV? How did you know that child wanted to be a girl or a boy or either? Why did you decide to take that child back home to your little beginner’s apartment? Why didn’t you have a mansion available? They have the nerve to bring other humans to this planet without consent of the child and when they bring you here they offer you the basics.I wish there was an option for babies to go back to wherever they came from. There needs to be like an initial interview process for parents. Assuming babies would be given the ability to understand the world as an adult. I mean adult as in a halfway intelligent adult because some of you have the mental capacity of a fruit fly. Parents need to be asked questions and allow babies to do extensive background checks. Babies should be able to ask important questions such as:·      On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your peach cobbler?·      Do you watch anime?·      Is your house spider proof?·      Can you fight?·      Do you eat an excess amount of genetically modified foods?If the child is not satisfied, the child should be able to go back to “living” a peaceful life without public restrooms and low-fat ice cream. The potential parents will then be banished back to the hood they claim and their memories will be wiped clean by the Men in Black.“We have to talk about liberating minds as well as liberating society.” -Angela Davis-

Mother Nature, The Stepmom From Hell


May 08, 2015
by Neal Gammons



Mother Nature, I am sure you’ve heard of her. She treats me like I’m her stepchild. I’m an expert on recognizing flawed stepmoms. I have had plenty experience with observing foolish stepmom behavior including everything from screwing up Shake N’ Bake chicken to spending energy bill money on clothes from Value City. Side note, I wouldn’t wish Shake N’ Bake chicken on my toughest foe’s dinner plate. Before we advance, I have to say Shake N’ Bake chicken is a sin and it should only exist in Mortal Kombat as a fatality move. Anyway, Mother Nature is the one that can make humans sweat and freeze all at the same time. Yes, that’s the sort of behavior she likes to engage in and she makes piss poor decisions every time. She is rude and disrespectful, especially to those of us living in the Midwestern United States. The summer weather hysteria has already begun without warning of course. Everything from the badass young people creeping around leaving Jordan shoe prints everywhere in the neighborhood to the unbearable heat has started. It’s not even June and the temperature outside already feels like the Devil and the Sun are slap boxing with each other. No one has enough baby powder to keep dry from all of Mother Nature’s steam room antics. I wish we could all just walk outside naked without judgment, but Adam and Eve’s nosy asses messed that up long ago. They messed it up over an apple. Not over a piece of birthday cake or a donut, but an apple! I bet if Mother Nature were a human she would probably be worse. She would be that mom that is always buying her kids junk food instead of real food with her EBT card. Her wig would probably smell like cigarettes and chitterlings (or chitlins for all my ebonics speaking people). Mother Nature isn’t being nurturing like she is supposed to be. On top of her making the weather around me miserable, Mother Nature has the nerve to make the hot weather an invitation for insects to come out and play. The 24-hour warm weather outside is like a Dave and Buster’s for insects, gross. I already don’t like humans and have actually wished you all away many times, but you mean I have to go outside and worry about insects flying in my face too? Mother Nature always makes me look like an idiot as I defend myself against flying bugs by windmilling them. Yes. I windmill flying bugs, it’s probably a more interesting fight than that Mayweather versus Pacquiao prom dance you all bet your MetroPCS bill money on. I just want for her to make better decisions. I am not asking this woman to be perfect. I’m waiting on some mythical CPS van full of cupcakes and air conditioning to take me away and save me from her. Mother’s Day is fast approaching and I hope Mother Nature has a super, magnificently, horrible day.  “Either you deal with what is the reality, or you can be sure that the reality is going to deal with you.” Alex Haley

My Mind Is For VIP Guests Only


March 28, 2015
by Neal Gammons



We all know that introverts are quiet for the most part, well, around strangers anyway. People LOVE asking us about what is on our mind. First of all, an introvert’s mind is sacred like the Garden of Eden, not some strip club you can just ease your way into. Contrary to what most people assume, I do think about more than just snacks and sleep. Although eating snacks and sleeping are some of the few reasons why I enjoy being human. There is so much activity that takes place in the mind that only introverts can understand.Why? In an instant, my mind could come up with a solution to achieve world peace and then transition to an orgasmic meal I had weeks ago, which is then followed by my second love called sleep. Introverts are not just being weird assholes when they respond to your “ What’s on your mind?” question with “everything”. Literally so many things are on our mind and not on display for you to read.The absolute worst thing for you to do though is ask “like what?” For some reason the “like what?” question awakens an irritation in me that even the finest of mental itch crèmes would quiver with fear. Like what you ask? At least follow the “Like what?” question with something of significance. Maybe I want to keep some of my thoughts to myself for the moment, you mind bully.People always want to know what is on my mind and then mock the information I give them. If you ask me what is on my mind and I tell you comic books and golden double-stuffed Oreos, that is not your cue to laugh. It’s fine, you won’t be laughing when I report your entire life as spam like I do to all of the other humans who crave small talk (the number one killer of introverts). Let’s do a little refresher before we proceed, shall we? Small talk was a tool created by Lucifer and every time people use it, Lucifer smiles because of satisfaction and twirls his weave with his finger like some hooker.If that illustration wasn’t enough to stop you from using small talk, then all of Middle Earth is doomed. Now let’s go back to discussing the more important matters. I only share my most precious thoughts with people I have strong connections with. Only certain people are allowed to hear my precious and random thoughts.It all depends on how you ask me. If I feel like you’re being genuine and the conversation isn’t some sick game of small talk, then I might tell you everything and more. Let me be frank, with the right amount of dark liquor and a certain level of attraction (not necessarily physical) for someone, I become more fluid with my thoughts.I see you reading this and you’re judging me now. Do not judge me, only Hermione Granger can do that. Even if I wanted to, my thoughts are difficult to pick out and articulate some times. That’s like me going to a bakery and picking out my “favorite” pastry when they all look tasty to me. I’d rather not attempt to tell someone what exactly is going on in my mind rather than to trying to say what is going on and then leave my victim confused. Because people are so annoying and I kind of love people, I do my best to reach into my mental Gucci bag to pull out some grand explanation that you probably do not even care about to begin with.An introvert’s mind isn’t easy to penetrate, but if you keep digging you might just find the diamond you were looking for. If you have ever gotten the chance to have deep conversation with an introvert, you deserve some sort of medal. “At some point you have to make a decision. Boundaries don’t keep other people out. They fence you in. Life is messy. That’s how we’re made. So, you can waste your lives drawing lines. Or you can live your life crossing them.” Shonda Rhimes
