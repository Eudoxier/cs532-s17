CX-E Premise Overview

 Unlock the Full Potential of Your Communications Infrastructure 





FUTURE-PROOF TODAY AND TOMORROW’S UC CHOICES
Considering an upgrade to your IT infrastructure but worried that your mixed UC landscape won’t allow you to make it happen?
If you have multiple vendors – Avaya, Cisco, Microsoft – all playing an important role in your IT environment, why switch? You don’t need to. If you’d like it all to work together for a powerful Unified Communications (UC) solution, AVST can help.
CX-E is ideally suited to ease the transition to your digital future – no matter what your UC landscape is today, or how it will look in the future. Premise or cloud, it all starts with CX-E. Interoperability with all major call control, email, IM, calendar, enterprise data, and mobile devices is how CX-E makes it possible.
There is no other UC platform that offers this level of interoperability. Make the most of today and tomorrow’s UC investments and transition to the Cloud, IP and Skype for Business over time. CX-E will lead the way.
