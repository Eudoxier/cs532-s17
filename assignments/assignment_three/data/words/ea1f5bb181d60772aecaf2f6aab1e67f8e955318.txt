Ultra Street Fighter II and Super Bomberman R hands-on previews

Published on February 7, 2017 by chrisscullion4 Comments 


Header image by Jorge Vargas
Two of the games I played at last month’s Switch UK premiere event share a lot in common.
Both are based on classic games that were bigger in the ‘90s, both are heavily focused on multiplayer gameplay, and both have received some criticism for their rumoured £40-£50 price points.
Having had the chance to briefly play both, it’s clear this is an argument that will continue until they’re released, and likely beyond that. Continue reading “Ultra Street Fighter II and Super Bomberman R hands-on previews” →

Snipperclips hands-on preview

Published on February 2, 2017 by chrisscullion9 Comments 


For every big Nintendo franchise out there – your Marios, your Zeldas, your Metroids – there’s usually another smaller one that’s widely ignored by the gaming public in general.
Sometimes these are proper retail games: the likes of Band Bros, Custom Robo Arena, Excitebots, the Bit Generations series and New Style Boutique were all strong titles that were so underappreciated they may as well have had photos of Ben Affleck on the cover (he’s a cinema legend, deal with it).
More often than not, though, these ignored gems have been digital-only releases tucked away in each Nintendo system’s rarely browsed eShop. Indulge me for a second, there’s a big list coming because this really annoys me.
Pushmo and its sequels. Art Style PiCOPiCT. Dr Mario & Germ Buster. Three separate Mario vs Donkey Kong games. Art Style Kubos (Precipice in the US). Hydroventure. Excitebike World Rally. Dillon’s Rolling Western. Harmoknight. BoxBoy and BoxBoxBoy. All seven Picross e games.
These were all digital titles published by Nintendo that were thoroughly enjoyed by me and most of those who bought them, but were tragically ignored by the masses and ultimately didn’t sell as well as they could and should have.
If you’re thinking of buying a Switch, please don’t let Snipperclips become the latest member of that club. Continue reading “Snipperclips hands-on preview” →

Arms hands-on preview

Published on January 24, 2017 by chrisscullion3 Comments 


There was a moment when I was playing Arms (not ARMS: come on, people) where I was suddenly hit with a flashback of something I’d experienced nearly a decade before.
It was when I performed a grab move in the game, flinging both my extendable arms at my opponent and pulling them towards me for a beat down.
“Shake the controllers”, the rep at the Switch event told me. “Shake them fast and you’ll do more damage.”
So I did. And as I did, I suddenly found myself at the Wii post-E3 event in 2007 again, trying out Mario & Sonic At The Olympic Games for the first time.
“Shake the Remote,” the rep told me back then. “Shake it fast and you’ll run faster.”
So I did. And I convinced myself then that it was a fad and ‘waggling’ wasn’t going to be a popular control method for too long.
We meet again, Old Scratch. Continue reading “Arms hands-on preview” →

Zelda: Breath Of The Wild Switch hands-on preview

Published on January 22, 2017January 22, 2017 by chrisscullion5 Comments 


I wasn’t fortunate enough to get to play the Breath Of The Wild Wii U demo back when it was doing the rounds after E3 last year.
By all accounts, the demo I played last week was the same as that one, with the only obvious difference being that this time it was running on Switch hardware.
Since the contents of the demo itself are more than half a year old now, I figured I’d spare you the same rundown of what it entails, what I got to see and the like. Every site worth its salt already has a hands-on preview of the Wii U version in its archives somewhere, so me adding my own would be like pissing into Lake Hylia.
What I can do, though, is tell you how it feels playing the game on the Switch, as well as going into other details like playing with the Joy-Con Grip and how easy it is to do the whole ‘switching from TV to handheld’ process. Continue reading “Zelda: Breath Of The Wild Switch hands-on preview” →

Let’s not piss around – the Switch is a handheld

Published on January 19, 2017 by chrisscullion11 Comments 


Ever since the late 1980s, when the Game Boy started its global dominance, there has been an overwhelming agreement on the difference between home consoles and handhelds.
A home console is one that, as the name suggests, can be played at home: you plug it into your television, sit back and enjoy all the platform-jumping, goal-scoring, enemy-fragging shindiggery you want from the comfort of your sofa.
A handheld, meanwhile, is a console you can take on the move with you. It has its own screen and, crucially, never needs a TV. You can take it wherever you like and play games on it no matter where you are in the world.
That’s why I’m really bewildered at the way many online are comparing the Switch to other consoles (including the Wii U). Although Nintendo – for some bizarre reason I still can’t comprehend – is adamant that the Switch is a home console, that’s frankly bullshit. It’s a handheld, and anyone saying otherwise is… well, ‘wrong’ sounds harsh. Not right, basically. Continue reading “Let’s not piss around – the Switch is a handheld” →
