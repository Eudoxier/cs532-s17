Learn More About Black Duck Products 






Our information security group now has a significantly easier way to determine which artifacts and versions are affected by any security vulnerability and which applications are impacted as a result. This capability did not exist before, so this is huge.
- Kostas Gaitanos , Senior Director of Development Services, FINRA  
We connected with Black Duck several months before our IPO because our investors, our board and our management team felt it was important – critical, in fact – to understand the health of our source code in terms of security, quality and licensing.
- Danielle Sheer, Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Carbonite  
Black Duck stands in a class of its own. From a return on investment standpoint, given the breadth of information we receive from the system and the ease of use, versus our expenditure, we find it to be a great investment. Life for us would be very difficult without Black Duck.
- Igor Lekht, Sr. Vice President AxiomSL
