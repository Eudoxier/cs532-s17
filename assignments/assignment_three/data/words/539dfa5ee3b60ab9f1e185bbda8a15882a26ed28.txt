Testimonials




CyberSN is the first recruitment service that actually wanted to know me off paper. They truly care about finding a position to enhance your abilities and ensure you achieve a great work/life balance. This is what recruiting should be.
- Christopher, Security Analyst, Massachusetts




Everyone at CyberSN has been wonderful in guiding my career into security. I have had multiple talks with multiple team members and each time they get me closer to a new job that I like.
- Joe, Junior Security Engineer, Boston, Integration Organization




Deidre, I wanted you to know that our CIO said he hasn't ever experienced staffing services like yours!
- David, Chief Security Engineer, Medical Instruments Fortune 500 company




You rock!  I am so thankful for your service; mostly that you always respond when I reach out and you share your progress on my behalf.  Thank you Deidre and CyberSN.
- Chris, Security Operations Specialist, MA




CyberSN was a great resource for my new job.  Having a talent agent made things less stressful and I felt more comfortable in the interviews; I never knew there was such a service for Cyber Security Professionals.  I am so thankful that I met CyberSN: the job they helped me get is awesome!
- Thomas, Operation Security Analyst, CA




You only staff Cyber Security Professionals?  Oh, goodness, that makes me so happy.  We need your help.
- Dawn, Fortune 100 Dir. of Security, MA




CyberSN was incredible. Having a talent agent is the best; I never knew there was such a service for cyber security professionals. I am so thankful that I met CyberSN: the offer they helped me generate was fantastic!
- Adam, Cyber Security Network Engineer, CA




I have never worked with a  recruiter that takes a vested interest in my job search.  CyberSN is a refreshing change from the run of the mill staffing firms out there these days.
- Jon, Senior Security Engineer, Financial Institution




You are the most unique recruiter I have ever worked with.  Not only do you give me the scoop on the position and the employer via Google Docs, but you also fight hard to give me all the prep info you can so I can do a better job on the interview. You are amazing and tenacious!
- Kevin, Information Security Engineer, Fortune 500 Computer Services Company




Part of the reason I stop looking for jobs or give up in the middle is because the process is so long it's not worth the hassle; it seems like CyberSN eliminates the hassle.
- Steve, Manager of Information Technology, FL
