Description



BCMCR Music Data Hack #1: 24-Hour Festival Data Hack
On 10th-11th February 2017, BCMCR and CHIME presents the first in a new series of 24-hour Music Data Hacks. The aim of these events is to bring together BCU researchers and students with data practitioners from the Birmingham area, to work collaboratively on the development of online data visualisation tools, product prototypes, and experimental analytical methods. The first of these events explores possible uses and applications for data collected about music festivals.
Using data collected from a small group of volunteers at the 2016 Cheltenham Jazz Festival through a pilot version of a mobile application BCMCR and CHIME are developing, along with social media data gathered from other festivalgoers during the festival, this hack aims to explore the ways in which the data collected could be visualised online in ways that are useful to researchers, festival organisers and music fans. 
Working in small teams, it is expected that participants will conceive, plan and build a working prototype of a visualisation interface within 24 hours. At the end of the hack prototypes will be evaluated by a panel of BCMCR researchers and festival practitioners. The winning team will be awarded a cash prize.
Researchers from BCMCR and representatives from a number of international music festivals will be in attendance at the hack to provide advice, support and guidance. The event will conclude with an informal drinks reception and networking event. 
Registration for the event is free, and tickets include refreshments and lunch. All data will be provided, but you will need to bring with you your own laptops, including any software or applications you intend to use during the course of the event. We cannot provide computers and/or software. 
We hope you will join us for the first in this series of Music Data Hack Events. We look forward to welcoming you on 10th/11th February.
