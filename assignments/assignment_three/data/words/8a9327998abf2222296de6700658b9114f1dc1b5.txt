The biggest benefit of bringing on Attain Technology is getting someone who understands the construction industry.
Before Attain Technology, we were using an outdated system.  We were not happy with our previous IT provider, they were overcharging, and nickel and diming us. They wanted to force expensive solutions on that really didn't fit our needs.
We needed someone who had knowledge of the construction industry and can tailor their services what New England Construction does. The biggest benefit of bringing on Attain Technology is getting someone who understands the construction industry.  Attain supports us in the field, they can remote in and work with our foremen and project managers wherever they are, and recommend construction specific solutions.

The Biggest Benefits Are the Service, Speed of Response, and Their Knowledge of IT.
Since East Coast Interiors joined forces with Attain Technology in 2009, we have grown from 10 people to 21 people in the office, while at the same time increasing from 120 people in the field to 350 people. Meaning that, we have tripled or field employees thereby tripling our top line revenue, while only doubling our office support.  You could argue that we have become more efficient in the office, where Attain Technology has made the greatest difference for us.
Our IT systems need to be 100% reliable since we have customers relying on us to respond in timely manner.   We are a lean office staff, with little down time.  Based on each person’s work load, a loss of hours in productivity cannot be made up in a regular work week.  In our fast paced business, a quick response time critical.  
Many of our associates need to work off site and must have access to the server as well as be able to log on from anywhere at any time.  Before, we suffered a lack of cohesiveness. Now, with Attain Technology, we have one system but can allocate different security levels so we can police what each person in the organization has visibility to. 
We were not tech savvy but have grown, making it necessary for us utilize data more efficiently and become more productive in the office. Better recording and data have allowed us to minimize costs by being more efficient. Even the frame in field is more tech savvy with the use of Procore.  We now have proper equipment i.e. printers, plotters, laptops, smartphones, Procore, servers, etc. that help us maximize the output of each employee. 
The biggest benefits of working with Attain Technology are the service, speed of response, and their knowledge of IT. It allows us to concentrate on our core business while they keep us informed on the tech side.
