What is KnowIT?

Secondly, KnowIT provides protection for your confidential data against IPR theft by tracking the movement and modification of your important files across and out of your network.
Thirdly, KnowIT provides protection against insider threats by letting you understand how your employees are using computer applications and websites and by inspecting network packets to identify suspicious behaviour or rogue applications. 
Finally KnowIT continual stream of data, alerts and reports gives you the information you need to improve your processes, and to make better business decisions.
