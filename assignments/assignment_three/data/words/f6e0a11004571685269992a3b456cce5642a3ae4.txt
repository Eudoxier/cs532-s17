Joey is a writer, editor, and musician who enjoys the craft of storytelling through text, audio, video, and other media. He has worked as a journalist, an editor for a software magazine and its corresponding websites, a digital copywriter for an online marketing firm, and a content and community manager at a nonprofit business mentoring website.Joey likes building creative relationships, brainstorming new solutions to tricky problems, helping people communicate more clearly and effectively, and losing/finding himself for a few hours in a book, or an album, or a forest. When he's not wordsmithing, he often can be found composing music that he uses to entertain his cats.






That thing I do.
