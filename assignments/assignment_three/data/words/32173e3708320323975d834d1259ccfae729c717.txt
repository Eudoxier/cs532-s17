See the schedule ›  Launchpad or 5-day course ›* Don’t have 5 days in a row to spare?Split up the course by attending the first two days of one session, and the last three days of a different session. See the details ›“The instructor for AlienVault’s Enterprise Security training class was a fountain of information and it was clear he understood the product at many levels. I feel comfortable with AlienVault USM since taking the class.”Stuart Irons SLM Asset & Security Management, Acora“I feel much more confident in my ability to administer AlienVault since taking the training.” Richard Kale IT Security, DUO NZ“I’m very satisfied with the course. Useful labs and great balance between theory and labs. The instructor has been a very knowledgeable trainer.” Rafael Rueda Director, OYDIA Strategic Security“The training provided our employee with the knowledge he needs to work with AlienVault and has given him additional ideas about what he can do with the product.” Susan L.

It is not available for private deliveries.The split is 2 days then 3 days. We regret that we cannot support any other combination.Students can attend either part In Person or Live Online.This doesn't change what is taught in class. It’s just a different way to take the class. All students still need to go through the entire class to learn how to plan, deploy, implement and operate USM to detect and mitigate modern threats.There is a chance you will have two different instructors. We can not guarantee the same instructor. This is a great opportunity for you to learn from two experts.Our SKU allows 180 days to take the training. Both parts of the training should be completed by 180 days after purchase.No substitutions: One person must take the entire course, no changing attendee after the split.
