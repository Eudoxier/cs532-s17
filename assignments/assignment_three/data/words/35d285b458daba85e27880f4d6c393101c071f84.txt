Hear what our customers say about us
Today's advanced networks allow businesses to share information with their employees, business partners and customers. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) allow businesses to leverage the power and cost advantages of the Internet. But with the advance of these systems and networks comes exposure to losses from viruses, hackers, spyware and other threats. Network performance and employee productivity is threatened by non-business Internet use. Cerdant solves these business challenges with a comprehensive suite of security products and services. Our state-of-the-art systems and 24x7x365 management capabilities are designed to protect the security, mobility and reliability of your valuable information and networks, allowing you to concentrate on your business.
