        “As we move from perimeter defense to borderless security, I love that SafeBreach can be the "ubiquity platform“ running at every point in my data center.”


        Nir Botzer | CISO, Clarizen

 






 

        “My view has always been that you need to monitor and detect BUT that‘s only half of it, prevention comes from thinking like a hacker and hiring individuals that think that
        way.”


        Keith O'Sullivan | VP Global Information Security, Time

 






 

        “It's not enough to just have security controls in place, you have to constantly test them for effectiveness to understand which threat scenarios will impact you the most.”


        Craig Rosen | VP and CISO, AppDynamics
