Trump called the U.S. media the enemy of the American people this afternoon. Oh… but he deleted the tweet… only to replace it with a nearly identify tweet that only removed the work "SICK!"
I have no idea why it was OK without "SICK!" but appropriate without it but it is just more of his alarming anti-media rhetoric.
Trump's words recall similar sentiments from Nixon, but at least he only said them behind closed doors:
December 1972 tape: Nixon told Kissinger, “The press is the enemy, the establishment is the enemy, the professors are the enemy."

If you’re reading this, then you’re not in the majority of humans. Asap Science reminds us to keep learning and to keep an open mind, because the group that we identify with is not as typical, as average, or as numerous as we probably think.

‘Star Wars’ just dropped a major bombshell about ‘The Last Jedi’
Major, major hint.

Is The Last Jedi singular or plural? Turns out several non-English (official) Star Wars Twitter accounts indicate we can expect it to be the plural of Jedi.

Congressman David Cicilline (D-RI) took to the House floor Thursday and compared Trump’s administration to Stranger Things. 
“Mornings might be for coffee and contemplation, but Chief Jim Hopper is not coming to rescue us. Like Mike, Lucas, Dustin, and Eleven, we must remain focused on the task at hand and hold this administration accountable so we can escape from our own version of the Upside Down.”

  Credit where credit it due. While Obama was ending his term the DOJ fought on his behalf in federal court, arguing against an order to deposit the full report with the court clerk for preservation in the ongoing trial of Abd al-Rahim Al-Nashiri. Al-Nashiri has alleged he was waterboarded while detained by the CIA.Trump's legal team issued a one-page notice of compliance stating they would be turning over a full copy of the Torture Report to the court as requested.You can view the notice here: https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3458952/2017-02-10-Notice-on-the-Deposit-of-the-SSCI.pdfCheck this out on Google+Filed Under: Google+ PostsNext Page »   I run on and highly recommend:    Copyright © 2017 · Epik Theme on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log in
