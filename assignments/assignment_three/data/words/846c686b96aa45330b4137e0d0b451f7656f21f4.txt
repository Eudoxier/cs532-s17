Thoughts from Our Founder & CEO
 
 
 


Hello there! 
Thank you for visiting our site and taking the time to read my note to you. My name is Michael Gargiulo and I am the CEO of Proxy Server. 
In 2007, I was constantly using free proxy servers to access blocked sites like MySpace and Facebook at school. Eventually, I got fed up with searching for the best free proxy servers, so I started building my own proxies for fun and for my friends.
In 2012, I rounded up my savings and purchased ProxyServer.com for $9,700 USD.  My dream was to build the best proxy server on the web because I was tired of the ads, slow speeds, blocked sites and broken pages most proxies have.
In just three years, Proxy Server has served over 9,000,000 visitors from more than 170 countries. Needless to say, we’ve been humbled at how many individuals we’ve helped access free, fast, open, and secure internet around the world.
In 2015, we released our best product yet, Proxy Server Pro for Windows and Mac computers. Proxy Server Pro gives you the fastest speeds we offer, access to any site online, and most importantly, security on every Wi-Fi in the world. With just one click, Proxy Server Pro encrypts and secures all of your data so you don’t have to worry about using public Wi-Fi ever again.
All of us at Proxy Server strive to give you the most fast, secure and personal experience possible. Whether it’s using our site, desktop application, or mobile app (coming in 2017), all of us have worked hard to make it easy for you to quickly and safely access any website, no matter where you are. 
Finally, I would love to hear any feedback, suggestions, or comments you have as continue to make it possible to explore our world online more quickly, freely, and securely. Without users like you, none of this would be possible. Feel free to drop us a line with your thoughts at support@proxyserver.com and I will get back to you as soon as I can!
Thank you,

Michael GargiuloCEO at Proxy Server
