Everything You Wanted Outside of Traditional AV
 “With traditional AV, you have signatures and other outdated technology. With [Carbon Black], you can see not only what is suspected, but also what files appeared in the timeframe…Instead of a clunky engine that just scans all day long, you get information you can actually use both for preventing malware/viruses/worms, but also tracking user behaviors and other important information.”





David M. – Administrator at an Information Technology & Services Company
