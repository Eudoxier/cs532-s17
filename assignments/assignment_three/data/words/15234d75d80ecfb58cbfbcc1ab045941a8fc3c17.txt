Solar Engineering Fund


                                        Kurt  Schwartz
                                    

The HTHNC Solar Engineering club is a group of students who gain experience in everything from project management and leadership to mechanical and electrical engineering by constructing a solar powered boat. This all culminates into a weekend long competition where schools from all over come together to compare their boats. 
The HTHNC Solar Engineering club has been around since 2010, and we've been evolving ever since. Whether you have years of experience or not at all, our club is a welcoming and educational experience. Aside from engineering or project management skills, we are a very tight-knit team and we make every effort to include everyone. 
With these funds we will be purchasing equipment necessary for a successful year of solar engineering. We are in need of a variety of miscellaneous bolts and fasteners and such, which will cost around $100 and 4 batteries at $400 a piece.
With your help we can make this year even better than the last!

Producing Productive Minds with Osmo


                                        Darci Robinson
                                    

At Apache Innovative School, we are about developing critical thinking skills instead of teaching for standardized tests. We aspire to bring into our classrooms as many tools as possible to develop a critically thinking mind. Osmo is a learning tool that fosters social intelligence and creative thinking by opening up the iPad to an endless number of kinesthetic activities in language, math and physics. The school itself serves students from diverse cultural, linguistic and ethnic backgrounds in grades pre-k through 6th, with 79% receiving free and reduced lunch. Recently, the focus of learning has changed from traditional instructional structures to more innovative instruction to better meet the student needs, offering genius hour projects and maker space time to all students. Genius hour and maker space projects for all students provide an opportunity to engage all of our students at a high level and in ways not previous offered. As a building, we realized we needed to change our instruction to meet the changing demographics of our students. We currently have two Osmos and have seen the heightened level of engagement among students and positive impact they have had on student learning.
The funds will be used to purchase 14 Osmo genius Kits. This would provide two kits per grade level. With the current grade level configuration, there are 4 classrooms at each grade level and each kit would be used by between 40 - 50 students. The Osmo Genius Kits are compatible and integrate with the iPads currently being used by students. The Osmos offer the teacher the ability to select learning options that meet specific student learning needs and give students the option of choice in their learning. Daniel Pink noted, control is great for creating compliance, while giving choice and autonomy creates engagement and fulfillment. In addition, access to technology is an equalizer for students from diverse backgrounds. The Osmo tools gives students access and new ways to interact with technology and collaborate with peers.
We will be purchasing 14 Osmo genius kits that include word, tangrams, newton and numbers interactive learning tools for grades K to 6. Our goal is to raise enough to purchase 14 kits and each kit costs approximately $100 through the Osmo website (https://www.playosmo.com/en/). This price was competitive with Amazon, Target and Walmart regular retail price.

Flexible Seating


                                        Kathleen Hartsell
                                    

Imagine a classroom where students walk in with the freedom to choose where they will work each day, based on their own needs. I firmly believe in the power of choice, even with our youngest learners.  The more choice students have, the more they will feel invested and responsible for their learning.  I have tested this theory in my classroom during our "Read to Self" time, where students choose any spot in the classroom where they can read quietly and comfortably.  I currently have yoga mats, pillows, reading buddies (stuffed animals), and a few small chairs readily accessible for students.  Here’s a video of what this has looked like in my classroom.  It has been quite a transformation.
I want to take this idea to the next level by transforming my classroom into a flexible seating environment.
Research has shown that flexible seating (balance balls, wobble chairs, soft seats, motion stools, etc.) leads to more focused behavior and engaged student learning. Through the use of flexible seating, my students will have opportunities to understand their own body signals and select the seating option they feel will be most beneficial to them to better support their learning.  I am looking to obtain 15-20 flexible seating options, so that every child may freely choose an option each day.  The seating types vary in price, from $10 for a soft seat to $109 for a hokki motion stool.  The Gaiam Kids Stay-N-Play Balance Balls ($20) are known to help increase focus by keeping the body actively in motion while children are working.  I currently have a small table with some cushions on the floor, which could also be used as a flexible seating location for students to work.  
Here are a few articles to better understand the flexible seating movement:
Flexible Classrooms: Providing the Learning Environment That Students Need
Why the 21st Century Classrooms May Remind You of Starbucks
I teach at a bilingual low-income school, which poses many challenges for my students both in and out of the classroom. Many of them are raised in single parent apartments and receive a free lunch based on their socioeconomic status.  Several of them don't have the freedom to participate in extracurricular activities and sports outside of school.  While I can't control what happens outside of the classroom, my goal is to keep my students safe, comfortable, and productive in my classroom. I strongly believe students become more engaged and retain more information when they are able to make a choice of the best working environment for them. Flexible seating options will help my students by promoting positive choice, helping to release extra energy, and increasing blood flow to their brains.

MCSC Class of 2017 Scholarship Fund


                                        Linda Donatoni
                                    

Our nation is founded upon the belief that if you work hard, you can make it; that if you work hard, opportunities will be available. But for many of our students, even after twelve years of tireless work, the dream of attending college remains out of reach for the lack of money, sometimes even as little as $500.  These scholarships can mean the difference between attending college, and staying home.Please consider donating to help build the Mastery Shoemaker Senior Class of 2017 Scholarship Fund! All seniors will apply for these scholarships during their Senior Seminar class (regardless of GPA and ACT scores) and recipients will be announced at Awards Night in June. Last year, we were able to provide SIX seniors with a $400 scholarship each! We hope to provide the same number of scholarships this year. Our scholarship recipients will be able to use this money to help make their post-secondary education more affordable (ie. help pay tuition, buy school books).Thank you!Ms. Donatoni (College Advisor) & the 12th grade team

Private Screening of Inspirational ‘Hidden Figures’ for Entire Middle School


                                        Lisa  Rodgers 
                                    

With your support, 428 middle school students will attend a private screening of Hidden Figures at the Alamo Drafthouse on February 28th. Our hope is to inspire an entire school of students with this previously untold piece of American history. At KIPP Austin, our goal is to eliminate the gap in academic achievement between students growing up in educationally under-served communities in East Austin and their peers in more affluent areas and ensure our students have the skills, support, and motivation they need to graduate from college. The vast majority of our students are first-generation college-bound students, who live in low-income neighborhoods in East Austin. 87% of our students are eligible for the federal free and reduced price meals program and 98% of students are African-American or Latino. Through hard work, perseverance, and extra time in school, they catch up to and frequently surpass the academic performance of their peers. We believe ‘Hidden Figures’ will resonate with our KIPPsters overcoming the barriers to college, and will encourage our students, particularly our female students, to pursue careers in the STEM fields. Your donation will cover:
