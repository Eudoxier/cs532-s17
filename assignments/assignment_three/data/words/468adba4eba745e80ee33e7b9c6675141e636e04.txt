The Republican-controlled Committee on House Administration voted along party lines on Tuesday to disband the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), which assists states with meeting voting system security guidelines. 
By a 6-3 vote, lawmakers approved the Election Assistance Commission Termination Act. The bill states that, upon being signed into law, the EAC will be “terminated and may not carry out any programs or activities.” 
The move comes as many voters are questioning Russia’s attempt to sway the U.S. election in favor of Donald Trump, and as the president himself is claiming that he lost the popular vote due to 3-5 million illegal voters. President Trump has promised that Vice President Mike Pence will head up an investigation of the 2016 election.
In a letter on Tuesday, the Brennan Center for Justice urged lawmakers to reject the termination of the EAC. 
“At a time when the vast majority of our country’s voting machines are outdated and in need of replacement, and after an election in which international criminals already attempted to hack our state voter registration systems, eliminating the EAC would pose a risky and irresponsible threat to our election infrastructure,” the letter stated.
