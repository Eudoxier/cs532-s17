The Problem
Social, mobile, digital and collaboration platforms—such as Slack, LinkedIn, Facebook, mobile app stores, Pastebin, Microsoft Teams, Reddit and more—have become the new cyber security battleground, presenting one of the largest and most dynamic risks to organizational security in decades. Modern organizations struggle with the scale, trusted nature, and lack of visibility of these platforms, and they’re vulnerable against a new breed of highly-effective attacks outside the perimeter, ranging from targeted phishing and spoofed accounts to executive threats and data loss.
