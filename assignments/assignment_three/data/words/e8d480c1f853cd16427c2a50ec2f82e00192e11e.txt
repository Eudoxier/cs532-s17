VisitorBobTo be honest I've long since stopped using my home scanner. A colleague got me onto Scanner Pro some time back (for iOS) and within just under 1 second I've got a nicely scanned document which has all the creases, dark lines etc. removed and the file is automatically converted to PDF (or JPEG) prior to being uploaded, in the background, to my cloud service. I can then access it anywhere – my computer, mobile, tablet, the internet etc. Obviously the cloud upload is optional. It also has OCR built in.
It's quicker than a conventional flatbed scanner, you can scan massive documents (e.g. A2 paper) and multiple pages are converted and compressed into one single PDF.
Pro Version (£3.99)

Free Version

Other software is available although this is the best in my experience.
